I came here with some girlfriends and we had a great time!! We came just to get drinks but we ended up staying for dinner because the vibe here is amazing!! This is the most beautiful rooftop and you will get the most amazing photos as well!!

When you get out of the elevator you get greeted by the most friendly staff (rare in NYC). Then they take your temperature with a super cool photo monitor (you have to see it to believe it!).  There is hand sanitizer at every table and the servers are wearing masks. We appreciate the level of high safety measures being taken!! Thank you!!

Love this place and it should definitely be on your bucket list if you are in NYC.

The waitress was obviously up selling us as soon as we got to the table - offered shots (which we got), prompted us to get better alcohol instead of house (which we did); and yet service was still extremely slow. We had to ask for water multiple times. Our food came out before drinks.

Mushroom pizza was pretty good; better than the pepperoni, tomato and pepper one (tasted like Subway).

Instagramable place; cool views; but overpriced and service sucked. Would go back if the night option presented itself but not necessarily dying to go back.",,,0x89c259d10e654f89:0x62d82b277df2095a

To many amazing options close by. Go elsewhere.

We arrived around 530p on a Saturday.  The place was at less than 50% occupancy.  Yet, they insisted on placing our party of three at a two person setup. Rude.

Beyond this, they had the windows shut and did not have the ac on. The place was a sauna - break a sweat hot. We opted to leave.

Ezy, the floor manager, was rude to my party and the one in front of us.   Customer service is not his strong suit. When we left another couple left as well and the only sizable party they had left as well.

To add insult to injury the uniforms are horrendous. Very 1950s nursing home. I don't know who the are catering to.

I didn't expect much from a Roadway Inn or of any Choice Hotel for a matter of fact. But this place takes the cake for the worst at service and the absolute nastiest room that I have ever stayed in. My military accommodations in Kuwait in Iraq were more attentive and clean. You shouldn't use this place if you have small children or a compromised immune system for the fact that you are likely to end up in the hospital. The place is filled with pubic hairs and cigarette smoke. The staff is miserable to include the highly impaired manager whom was clearly under the influence of something strong. Tony's attitude is award winning and demeaning. The personal insults and disregard of people with disabilities was just shameful to witness. Choice Hotels will be hearing from me and in particular about Tony's questioning of a Desert Storm Veterans disability. Tony the nasty receptionists whom has a personal calling to involve herself in others conversations and unwitting ability to propel insult toward customers valid complaints.

I just had my daughters 5th birthday party at the pool. We talked with them face to face with a Penny in May in June she emailed me which I have. I called said wait for me to figure out whether or not we want food (only cake was allowed everything was to be bought from the kitchen which I understand) but she said ""it was on the books""

Well day of the party July 9th show up no one knows anything about it. There was garbage all around the pool (pretty normal for this place) no chairs or tables, water everywhere not even close to the pool, & the kitchen was closed so we couldn't get food if we wanted. Only perk the man working the desk was helpful.

Called to complain to the company that I spent that much money on renting out the pool for a private event to have it go so bad. They sent me to the assistant manager who then told me this was my own fault. There needed to be a down payment and signed contract. I have witness with me as well as emails to prove there was no mention of either. He said she never would do that and I should of called to do it. Basically calling me a lair.

Surprised that we'd get a ""resort and spa"", but whatever. Then we looked at the pictures online, and it definitely looked a bit dated. Expectations were tempered. It vainly wasn't the fanciest place ever, but it was decent. No, the accommodations weren't the most modern. The regular rooms were a touch small, but they were clean and the balconies were nice. We had friends who got a suite, which was much roomier. The pool was EXCELLENT.. very large, and they even have a lifeguard on duty. Front desk staff wasn't the friendliest, but we talked to the manager a couple of times, and she was fantastic. Don't eat at the restaurant, the are CLEARLY not prepared for more than 2-3 tables at a time. We ate dinner and breakfast there, and service was painfully slow (though the good was pretty good). Very hockey-friendly hotel, had no problems with our kids playing knee hockey. They also gave us a complimentary party room for a team party.

Room was 'picked up' but it didnt really seem clean at all, was told phone in room didnt work (didnt want or need to use it, but i noticed hotel staff surely can call into room on 'broken' phone), tv is tiny (like 19"" MAYBE 27""- and NOT flat screen i dont believe), doors still take an actual key (didnt realize that was still a thing at hotels), rug looked at least 20+ yrs old- id say whole place needs updating, like badly... they could charge more money if they invested into their moneymaker... not likely to go back, id rather pay a few more bucks for an upgraded, clean room with a phone that is an option to use, if needed.
To be fair- i should mention the place seemed fairly quiet, a.c. worked well, and no one bothered me while inside. If your main priority is cheap- this is your place- but it still seems a little over-priced for lack of quality in the room...",,,0x89da99e9e051c4e3:0xd5ca208984377d30

Don't believe all of these nasty reviews because this place isn't THAT bad. They have good wifi so that's a plus. But in my room they only have one outlet and it is in the corner of the room. I left my extension cord at home and I wouldn't want a long wire in the middle of my room anyway. You have to set the clocks and the rooms are kind of old fashioned. It's good though like me who is only staying the weekend and is visiting someone in college. So in conclusion, I believe that people are just exaggerating and that this place is a ok place to stay.

EDIT: I thought this was a good place to stay. I had written that review a hour after we got the key. That was before the beds. They were so uncomfortable I couldn't even sleep. The breakfast was just a few muffins the size of my thumb with coffee that tasted very dull.  All together, this place looks like it was frozen in the 70's.

The owners are really nice and try their best to help you with anything you need. The first day of our trip it was raining so we just ended up going to the Montecillo Casino. They have a few old kayaks that you can use but other than that there is really not much to do around here except for grilling/picnic or sun tanning.,"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJBpqO6jqdk1OXqC7r0pWJwQiw1svazlMAlqMU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNScP9whIw2S12fkBNMP2JAuORdSEprUvJ2b7L7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN0bzXtMsE27b85E3CKFTf-I3vaknhOpXHAkLi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwrma9vOdjslP7YW0ZJG2LTtsR5z22tNt_ZcI4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHIOv_oqLlqpP6PIWtjZHZFiJETHyi8mBXDNig=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFZaWeVK7lN9e1Ls7oqKTCQz_w52VYmaISfYQg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x89c352e996ab601d:0x5d13ba2c4f2da9f8

When we asked to sing a song, the old man ""dj"" held up a sheet of paper with like 5 names on it and said don't bother it was gonna be a long wait. So we sat and tried to wait. The problem is that a bunch of woo hoo girls (and not the good kind) were holding on to mics, listening to their own music, and occasionally throwing in a lyric of a refrain of a song. The same 6 girls held the microphones and proceeded to have their own conversation. Not letting anyone do actual karaoke. When we reviewed on Facebook, the staff was quite snarky and retorted with ""well we are sorry you didn't have fun like everyone else did"" and ""that is how they like to do karaoke here"" umm, pardon me but 1. That isn't karaoke, and 2 you will never attract new customers with attitudes like that.

He snapped at me and held up a sheet (with about 5 names on it) and said that it would be a long wait. I then sat through two more songs with the same drunk 7 women holding the microphones and occasionally singing a half chorus of whatever lame song they chose.

Taxi driver didn't like the hotel because of the neighborhood. He said be careful but next morning early I walked to the Jamaica–179 Street Station to Manhattan. It was perfectly fine to walk by nice houses and neighborhood. Breakfast was not good everything was packed. Room size for a 6.1 feet tall with two bags was small but it was silent. Silence is important because if you can't sleep it is not important how wide room that you stayed.  So overall above expectations.,,,0x89c2613d37dfa795:0x9b64f785629b08d1

The hotel itself is on the older side. Not anything fancy, but the rooms were very clean, and the staff was very friendly! I also appreciate that it was pet friendly!",,,0x89d87e999878b791:0xb12ec02904de1ec1

My last visit I wasn’t to satisfied with the cleanliness of my bed and sheets. Recycling sheets and pillows after a long time of being used, is completely unsanitary. A low budget hotel or not, there’s certain requirements when running an establishment like so. Also, I just currently came here and I’ve never heard of a hotel that doesn’t let you check in until 4 pm especially when check out for previous over night guests is at 12 pm. No one can wait in the lobby. I took 2 hours to get here and I’m pregnant, the receptionist explained that I couldn’t wait until check in time which was only a hour to come after my arrival. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. With the amount of funds this hotel receives everyday there is no reason that you guys still have yet to buy new things, upgrade items and at least train your workers with common courtesy. Honestly, if this problem persists... as a active member of the community board, I will gladly bring this problem to their attention and push for a thorough investigation.

When I got there the manager was at the front desk, playing on his cell phone, and didn't even bother to acknowledge my existence for a good 2-3 minutes while he finished what he was doing. No  'hello', 'how are you', nothing. I got a frank ""Checking out?"" ""Yes, at 3:30p I am checking out."" ""Huh"", messes around silently with the computer for another 1-2 min, ""Are you Bridgett? I need your credit card"". We get checked in and he tells me I'm going to need to wait while he tried to find the housekeeper because she was supposed to call him at 3 to tell him rooms were cleaned but ""apparently has chosen not to today"". Professional. Comes back 5 minutes later to tell me I can go to my room. The room. Wow. Carpets look like they hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Room smelled like musty, stale cigarettes. The window curtains were stained with God knows what (probably uncleaned blood for the brutal attack that happened there 6/5/2016-as i learned later). Around midnight, there's a knock on my room door. By the time I get to the door, gone. I make sure the door is double locked from the inside and get back in bed. Then I can hear someone outside the room with a key trying to get in the room. I get up, throw the door open, and asked ""what can I do for you?"" This poor guy apologizes, saying he saw the door tag on the door and informed the desk clerk that someone was in this room but they insisted the room was empty and told him to try getting in anyways. Wonderful. Beds suck and are uncomfortable but at this point are the least of my concerns. The next morning I woke up to staff outside my door very loudly complaining about another customer that had just checked out. When I checked out the woman at the front told me I was all set and asked ""Did someone come to your door last night? We don't even have you in our system"". Really? Because the guy clearly knew my name and took my money. ""Oh yeah, that was the manager. He can be a bonehead."" Absolutely unreal.

In the room nothing worked or was connected. You could only watch TV of you could figure out the proper way to hookup and program the cable box. Air conditioning was an almost laughable myth. First you have to plug it in yourself. Then it doesn't cool the air, just blows the hot air gently around the curtains. Don't bother trying to call the front desk. Your phone phone, clearly marked as being from a room on a different floor, has a dial tone, but none of the keys work. It would matter anyway, there is no maintenance staff to fix the air conditioning, out phone. While there was a mini fridge and a microwave, they had be negated for some time. Freezer burned food had become one with the tiny freezer unit in the fridge.

The bathroom was usable, but only just. For a family of four, only two bath towels, one hand towel, and one wash cloth were provided. The empty tissue box was left in the wall dispenser with no replacement available. One roll of toilet paper was provided on the back of the toilet, as the two holders were broken. Black mold is clearly visible on the drop ceiling and in every corner.

The bed was a long size as advertised. Being extra soft and springy, the toddler found it worked best as a trampoline.

Moral of the story: the Hilton, a block closer to the airport, is worth the $45 more a night.",,,0x89de0d1933c5eb53:0x30862ff9c89c138a

The entire building, including the non-smoking room my family had, reeked of old cigarette smoke, the bed had no support left in it whatsoever, the air conditioning did not work (either to cool air or even move it around!), the window did not open, and even if it could, the screen was destroyed, bathroom fixtures were rusty and some broken, grounds were unkempt and overgrown, and the location, while nice and close to the airport, is across the street from a youth correctional facility and next door to a car rental and shipping depot. This was nowhere near worth the $99/night rate for the park and fly package. I will gladly spend more for future trips to never stay at this dump ever again.",,,0x89de0d1933c5eb53:0x30862ff9c89c138a

We arrived at the Inn and it was sub-par, the rooms were out of date, and things were starting to fall apart. Our mirror in the bathroom was held together by duct tape and the towel rack fell off the wall when I removed a towel. We paid a lot of money for a ""package deal' that came with an $80 gift card to their two ""amazing"" restaurants. We were excited to go to Lorenzo's which was supposed to be the higher end restaurant, but it was never open. Since Traveler's was the only other place to take the gift card we had to go there, the food was pretty good but the service was absolutely horrible. There were four waitresses standing around talking the whole night while one poor waiter tried to keep up with every table. They also forgot to tell us that neither of the restaurants are open on Sunday so we were left with $30 on the gift card that could never be used.

The Country Inn had mold in the tub, the phone didn't work, and other issues with the room.  They didn't change my room so I left. I went to Motel 6 and something must have been going on in the area because that was the only hotel available in Long Island City.  The only people there were others who couldn't find rooms at other hotels.  When I checked in,  I told the gentleman behind the desk of my experience at The Country Inn, and he laughed and said ""The phone here probably won't work either "". I thought he was joking until I got to the room and there was no closet, no ironing board or iron, the phone didn't work,  amongst other things.  I went to the front desk and the guy said that he'd make a note of it and if have to talk to the manager in the morning.  The manager the next day didn't come in until noon and still didn't care and did nothing about the issue.  I'd never stay there again and would recommend others not to go.

Our group decided to order the soups of the day- and there were a half dozen tempting offerings. I was torn between the Pork and Barley or the Cheeseburger Chowder. I ended up ordering the Cheeseburger Chowder and was very pleased with my selection. My only regret is that I ordered a cup rather than a bowl, because it was simply excellent! My companions opted for the French Onion Soup and they both raved about it. To go with our soups, we all ordered sandwiches- I had the Grilled Cheese, they had Reubens. Again, all of us agreed that our sandwiches were very tasty! I was very happy with the quality of the food, it was better than average. I feel the portions were generous too, as well as everything seemed very fresh and delicious.

Beyond the very satisfying meals, we all enjoyed the ambiance of this establishment. When you reach the front door, you immediately take note of a small plaque denoting that the place goes back to 1861, as a history buff I really found this interesting. It's clear that the building has been around a LONG time, it has the charm. It is a well maintained looking place and oozes charm and warmth. It was interesting to read that the same family has owned and operated the place for a century and it is also a functioning hotel! Pretty cool!

The service was good, our server was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable and fair. So, overall, in every aspect...The American Hotel left us pleased with our decision to check it out. We left saying that we would return! This place would make most people happy in my opinion!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVI3vgDnkkgvlMbi9hKvqfmi2XnMCw5BKZKbFV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpACn-v0RQ7H8JlI7Ew1zA8urXhMdIj1Hf797z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcW1s6WCHRLRoqSF51MryFKwEQpEecwBx6rRmW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6dxUXS3477GjLIeIlFjYUEuuCpJpGcZopt_11=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkLaUFgD9wEAlXyWlXZ3ykSXO65kOst2O3ysi0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXkj8Ly3JVejgvxk20qBbjoNE8dCStZ-UaLeNM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x89d146de5a94ee45:0x9c237574ffe7ae2d

I first had a very nice room at the front and then moved to a suite at the back, both on the top floor, which I think was the sixth or seventh.  I then, unfortunately, renewed via the internet and opted for a slightly cheaper room on the floor below, the mouse visitor having apparently left - true and not being snide, it was very small and the rooms were very clean - I put down food for it but then it disappeared.  There was some problem with the room change and I was asked to leave, perhaps because they found out about the mice feeding, and there were no rooms available on subsequent visits.  However, it was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in and convenient for food and I would highly recommend it, although having to be accompanied in the lift was slightly stressful and it's quite a long work otherwise.",,,0x89c259a78a9e2a79:0x830b08f0443eb24d

You can take a nice stroll to Madison Square Park or the Empire State building. I love the TV service and mini fridge and the suite setup I had. However, I can only see more negatives about this hotel than I can see positive. I want to honestly say the hotel isn't worth what I paid for. It has cheap quality for expensive prices. I was already concerned when the receptionist looked like he didn't know what he was doing every time I walked through the lobby. I was right to be concerned because they put me in the wrong room. I will applaud the fast speed of resolving that issue, however; there were only two outlets in the room, both at very awkward and inconvenient locations. At one point the outlet fried my charger, forcing me to buy a new one after the receptionist looked clueless about my complaint. The toilet doesn't flush all the way, you'll have to flush it twice to get even a small sheet of tissue down. That was a big turn off for me. They deducted an extra $25 as a deposit in case there was any damages in the room after I left, this would be returned to my card if no damages were made. I can definitely understand this, but it was not mentioned to me at all upon booking my room which was very upsetting. When I first initially reserved the room, I was informed my grand total would be $380, but then the price raised to $410, and then it raised to $477. I don't understand why because I booked the room for what it was worth at $380 but ended up paying $477, such a total ripoff. I saw reviews and was warned by a random user to book somewhere else. But knowing we as humans have different tastes, I booked it anyway to give it a chance. But I'm very bitter about my stay overall and will not suggest this place to anyone. I wish I took the advice to book somewhere else.",,,0x89c259a78a9e2a79:0x830b08f0443eb24d

Access to a beautiful lake with swimming, boating and fishing at your doorstep is a wonderful experience. Office and maintenance staff are wonderful people who respond to your needs.  Be aware that some cabins are accessed from upper road parking down pretty steep lawns.  Some renters were using their trucks and SUVs with AWD and 4WD to drive down grass slopes to unload and load their vehicles.

American breakfast is available.
The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful. It is approx. 10 to 15 minutes to the NY subway station Atlantic Terminal. Various subways leave from there. Another stop is Union Street. This is a little closer, but there are fewer subways there. You can be in Manhattan in about 20 minutes.
The hotel is simple and clean. However, because of the extreme volume at night, I would not recommend it. The rooms are also noisy.
There is no safe and no refrigerator in the room.
WiFi is free of charge, as is the use of the PC in the entrance area.

Das Hotel liegt in NY in der Butler-Street in einem kleinen Gewerbegebiet. Gegenüber befinden sich Autowerkstätten. Es wird dort auch nachts gearbeitet. Somit ist es dort sehr laut.
Es wird amerikanisches Frühstück angeboten.
Das gesamte Personal ist überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Bis zur NY-Subway- Station Atlantic Terminal sind es ca. 10 bis 15 Minuten. Dort fahren verschiedene U-Bahnen ab. Eine weitere Station ist Union Street. Diese ist etwas näher, allerdings fahren dort weniger U-Bahnen. Man ist in ca. 20 Minuten in Manhatten.
Das Hotel ist einfach und sauber. Wegen der extremen Lautstärke in der Nacht würde ich es allerdings nicht empfehlen. Ebenso sind die Zimmer recht hellhörig.
Es gibt im Zimmer keinen Safe und keinen Kühlschrank.

They won’t even accept deliveries (courier) on behalf of guests, so I had to camp out at reception all day for UPS to arrive. The rooms are tiny, 15 ft by 15 ft at most and the ensuite toilet was an afterthought. Check in time is 1600 hrs; if you arrive early, as we did, we had to leave and come back after 1600 hrs. They charge USD7 for every piece of luggage stored in their luggage room.  A rip off, if you ask me; but we didn’t have a choice. Opportunist capitalists!

On the plus side, at USD29/night the rate is considered the cheapest in NYC; the fridge is large and they supply towels. The only useful thing reception did for us was to give us two sets of keys.

There is no breakfast even though it is on the website. No towels by the pool ever. You have to go ask for one and who wants to do that when your wet. Don’t you dare ask for a late check out. They make you feel like you asked for a loan if you do. Spider webs in the room by the lights. Parking lot full of garbage and the outside area by doors full of cigarette butts and garbage. They don’t deep clean in-between guests is the first thing that comes to mind as a reason for that. I don’t know. For a more expensive room in the area, I really expected more.

We booked two queens for me, my wife and daughter and we had just driven 6 hours.  They first tried to tell us that we booked a single (occupant) but our reservation clearly showed it was for 3.  The woman was making all kinds of BS excuses and lies.  The lobby stunk of chlorine and there was a paper sign stating the pool was out of service.
When we got to the room, it was just ok but kinda felt cheap.  The towels were absolutely horrible and were so rough they felt like brillo.  Would never go there again.  BE ADVISED!",,,0x89d9e8d2ecfaaaab:0xe3eb74228cc16f6a

They took $15 off the stay. I was ok with that. Upon check in(3pm), I tried to find the entrance. The one that looked like it had tarps and dust all over. It looked like an abandoned building. I called to confirm the entrance and was told it was. There was plastic and dust everywhere in the ""lobby"". I brushed it off since they gave me a discount.  I got to the room and the key didn't work. The couple next door were having the same problem. Luckily the second key worked so I didn't have to go bacl to the front desk. I wanted to take a nap but it was still light out. When I went to close the curtains, I noticed they were very dirty. It was like someone with oil on there hands closed them. After my nap I wanted to watch t.v. but the satellite was down... I was quite disappointed but at least the wifi worked. The next morning when I went to shower I noticed quite a but of black mold on the ceiling and wallpaper in the shower. It made me feel dirtier than before I showered.

The nearby environment is very quiet, parking and unloading luggage are very convenient. There is a paid parking lot across the street. South St seaport is just a few blocks away. The only downside is that it is a long way to get to the nearest Fulton subway station, which takes about ten minutes. This is not particularly good. It can only be said that if you want to live next to the subway, this is not your choice. Our room is around the corner,

酒店位置不错，就在下高速的地方。附近环境很安静，停车，卸行李都很方便。街对面有一个收费的停车场。South St seaport 就在不远几个街区处。唯一不足的就是走到最近的Fulton地铁站比较远，大概需要十分钟。这不是特别好，只能说如果你想住在地铁旁边的话，这不是你的选择。我们的房间在拐角处，",,,0x89c25a3cb220501d:0x69fe4bc857c0b3b9

When we asked for someone to come up and help, the front door girl showed up with a plunger and meekly handed it to us to do ourselves.

On top of that, who ever hired the contractors to develop this hotel should be sued and then lose their licenses, there was dried grout all over the tiles, holes and pencil markings all over the walls, there are light switches that don't turn anything on and lights that have no switch! Our phone wasn't working so the handy man had to come in and out several times; turns out it wasn't even plugged in. The walls are incredible thin, we could hear someone else's TV blaring from down the hall and the gap between the door and floor is so huge you can see the feet of those who walk by.
