I have stayed at many Days Inns thru out the US. I find these Hotels to be a nice stay for the value. Usually clean rooms, good customer service, and clean linen. But this Hotel was dirty, Horrible customer service and dirty linen. The room was Hot and uncomfortable to sleep. The sheets were dirty with food spots and other soils. The Carpet was also dirty with spots. Wires were exposed in the wall.

I called to be changed to another room and they told me they couldn't because they were full, which was not true. I stayed here for three days and pre-paid and they wouldn't give me a refund. Next time I would totally pay an extra 10 bucks and stay at another hotel.

Let me just start by saying we had reservations but when we checked in they said price went up...we were here on a big mountain bike event and there was no rooms available elsewhere. Beds were nasty and forced us to go to Wal-Mart and buy sleeping bags. Inside of the rooms are falling apart.. burn marks on comforters. Carpet looked like they were slashed with a blade. TV was super snowy and direct tv was a joke. Only one channel worked for us. Called reception and it rang another room. Also, seems like there is long term residents here. Outside of building is falling apart as well and seems like no one cleans at all. There was trash everywhere. Roof is falling apart and missing shingles. This place needs a major make over with large investment or a wrecking ball.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQhcDAU7UKwiWncCP36z12QXv5xECZ_X2T4uBf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEcjeW1HI4363vmkhiiFDDUpl3vYSrpnN2kmCI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkaO7JfeNGs8nz0ErrZgtHRWWlZFI6dMGIWazL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x808de453b2d0a755:0xa33bb70829e596eb,California,,,Negative,No message

entire property is littered with garbage and cigarette butts. I was there when The Monterey County Health Dept.had red tagged the pool, locked it with their pad lock and had put a big warning sign on the entrance to the pool and jaccuzzi.

The carpets are so dirty that your white socks get black just walking around the room after a short period of time.

Musty rooms with boken microwaves, wires hanging out, wrecked cars and PODS in the parking lot, cig burns in the blankets, lumpy pillows on old mattresses,  beer cans and trash found under the bed, bare bones breakfast lacking anything remotely good for you, suspect people roaming the parking lot at night, etc. etc, etc..

Even the staff laugh at what they're asking for the rooms !!

And the older Eastern Indian lady in the office had such a short fuse that when confronted with the health and safety violations on the property and overall cleanliness of the pool and property, she sent her punk ass husband out to to threaten to ""kick my ass."" Really ?

1.1231555302743232e+20,Brett Chik,2021-06-20 05:46:19.271,3,"The hotel has been closed since December but reopened recently and we started on the first night it was open.

The good:
- The service was amazing. Everyone we interacted with had the utmost level of professionalism. The doormen greeted me by name each time we came and went which was a really nice touch.
- The room had an incredible view of the Bay.
- Room service was very quick.
- Staff was very fast to respond to the Four Seasons in-app messaging.
- Everything was clean and modern.
- The crab and shrimp omelette was delicious.
- Wireless charger and USB ports on the nightstand was a nice touch.

The bad:
- The was no in-room dining menu in our room nor any instructions on where to find one. We had to ask for a link to the menu.
- The coffee was absolutely terrible.  I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it was some the worst I have ever had my life.  After disliking it in one meal, they provided it complimentary in another meal but it was still quite bad. The problem likely isn‚Äôt the preparation but rather the selected beans. SF has a number of amazing roasters, they should seek out a better option from a local roaster.
- Doors slamming all morning long. I don‚Äôt know if it was Staff or guests, but from around 8 am too 11 am, doors near our room were constantly being opened and closed and quite loudly.  This woke me up and prevented me from getting as much sleep as I wanted to.  The doors need to be assisted so they close quietly.
- The toilet paper was completely awful, very thin and quite abrasive. This was so pretty surprising detail and I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how the product they were using would even be considered remotely up to their standards.

Overall, it wasn‚Äôt too bad but I don‚Äôt think it lived up to their reputation. I know they recently reopened and there are mistakes to be expected but something like low quality toilet paper doesn‚Äôt really have an excuse.  I hope this review will allow them the opportunity to make improvements where there are currently deficits.

I‚Äôm not sure I would stay there again at that price point given the above issues.",,0x80858061fa1762a5:0x197a26840ad26c3e,California,,,Positive,No message

The fruit and bagels were decent enough but it felt more like a break room for employees than anything I'd consider to be for guests. No employees present, just a few guests, a few tables, and some snack foods tossed together.

The hand towel in the bathroom had a rather dark stain on it, I'm assuming from the last guest that put it back well enough the cleaning staff didn't bother checking. The overall cleanliness of the room was suspect...I found hair in the bed that wasn't mine.

Overall for what it cost for the night it was adequate, if the above doesn't bother you of course.",,0x808fccb7339a1805:0xdbc868322a7462e9,California,,,Positive,No message

I found the room to be clean with a nice big fridge and comfy bed. The lights freaked me out a few times until I figured out how to turn the sensors off. An important thing to know about this area is it gets very loud outside on the weekend nights, there is a billiard hall and a couple nightclubs with loud people and motorcycles. If you want to get any sleep friday or saturday night before 2am bring earplugs and tylenol pm. Across the street from the front desk there is a bakery that has the most amazing cream puffs and other treats. You can't beat the free parking, that is what always brings me back here during conventions, they lock the parking lot up at night for anyone who doesn't have a key so I felt safe walking back to my room after dark.",,0x808fccb7339a1805:0xdbc868322a7462e9,California,,,Positive,No message

The rooms are spacious and business grade.  You have free wi-fi, ice, central heating/air, clean linen, adjustable beds (sleep number), coffee maker, alarm clock radio, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap.  The view of the lake was grand with a fountain, geese on the water, a Koi fish pond with it's own fountain and a nice pathway.  The hotel also has a swimming pool with a safety fence a small amphitheater area with soft music coming through speakers when not in use. There are ice rooms located around the property with soda machines.

The convention rooms are elegant and host many events. There is a Grill that serves and offers room service, a Bar but my favorite is the dining room.  The breakfasts were fresh cooked daily whether it was served or buffet and refilled often.  The morning servers along with the chef and cooks were very friendly and personable. They were my favorite part of the experience not excluding Sylvia at the front desk.

The rooms are very clean along with their bathrooms. Because of the fear of bed bugs in some of the local motels and extended stay hotels this was a pleasant experience. alleviating those concerns. All concerns are addressed immediately (not that there should be any but things can happen).

Do be aware that during the wet season it tended to flood in front of the entrance to the hotel's property. (This might have been addressed by now)

The check in was quick and easy, and the front desk staff were efficient and friendly. They were able to answer my questions about the hotel and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. This is a limited service hotel as they don't have a restaurant on property.

I had a room with a king sized bed at the back of the property. The room was spacious, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the wifi was adequate, and the bathroom was clean. I didn't leave the a/c on when I wasn't in the room, so most importantly, the air conditioning was fantastic and cooled the room quickly. I also appreciated the large HDTV.

The pool area and jacuzzi faces south, so it's perfect for sun bathing.

This old Ramada Inn was renovated by the current owner, and they did a brilliant job. The interior designers transformed this tired chain hotel into a unique and hip boutique hotel.

I know what a value is when I see it.  Due to a fire in my home I needed a place to stay.  Having lived in Palm Springs for over 20 years, I watched as this hotel like most things in Palm Springs was brought back to life.  I never imagined it would be so nice and at such a great price.  Beats the heck out of Motel 6.  Better ptice, much nicer room, free wifi ($2.99 a day at Motel 6) and a free breakfast.  Not just a contintal breakfast or just coffee, but a real breakfast.  In a real restaurant with real servers and some of the best food in town.  Rick's has always been a favorite of my Late husband and myself.  If you are even thinking of staying anywhere else, STOP, look and listen, this is THE only place hands down.

Being that my reservations were for only 4 days they were able to find me a room for the remaining of my stay. The first room was big and roomy. Room 205. The second room had a balcony which the view was beautiful. Lush green trees, peaceful, Room 209.  What I really appreciated so much is that they allowed me to take care of my mom's service dog. My mom fractured her hip and could not take care of her pooch. I explained the situation and they allowed me to bring my mom's pooch to stay with me. They were so understanding, it was incredible, and meant so much to both my mom and myself. This really goes above and beyond. All of the staff are so nice. I would highly  recommend this hotel.

Despite its small size, it has a fantastic restaurant, very spacious and assortment of all kinds of food as well as a large selection to make a full breakfast before the day's departure.

On the other hand it is next to the Fresno airport so in 5 minutes walking you can take the next plane to Yosemite, Grand Canyon or San Francisco. A good place to spend a night and shot of bars and restaurants typical of the American West Coast.

We stayed on the ground floor. The room was nicer than Motel 6, but not $200/night nicer. Neighbors doors could be heard closing. Upstairs neighbors sounded lime a herd of elephants. Parking is bizarre, being underground and not well lit, plus no elevator from the bottom. For the money, you might expect more than plastic-wrapped grocery store danishes, bad coffee, apple and orange juices, toast, and apples and oranges. Maybe should have cereal, cocoa, more fruit options, yogurts, bagels, etc. Half the electrical plugs wouldn't hold the pins for our phone chargers amd the plugs are difficult to get to. No pool.

On the plus side, it's four blocks from the beach and across the street from the San Francisco Zoo and just a couple miles to the VA Medical Center. The beds aren't high end, but they are relatively comfortable. It's probably worth $100/night, but that's it.",,0x808f7d7022cf8e85:0x68c3151307f1fca4,California,,,Positive,No message

It didn't have an elevator to the upper floors, so you have to lug your suitcases up &down stairs by yourself. Complimentary breakfast exists solely of coffe, tea, juice & packaged danishes. Even 1/2 of the toaster didn't work. There's no main room to eat, so you have to juggle your food & drink up the stairs to your room or make several trips.
The manager Amy, who's probably a relative, was arrogant & rude on several occasions to my sister-in-law.",,0x808f7d7022cf8e85:0x68c3151307f1fca4,California,2017-08-09 15:05:31.813,"Hi Rose,

Walk through the door as a late check in and the girl states immediately we don't have no rooms! Not even a hello or welcome. Then say we have a reservation and the girls tells us that there no expecting any more guest. After I give her confirmation number and then she say OK here your key and I will be leaving at 11 which was in 10mins. Making sure to let us know she is in a rush when its says they close at 12 so I guess thy come and go whenever they please. Check in and go unload car with luggage's and bags as I get to front door I'm struggling to open door and the front desk girl just sits at her like a big ol slob and doesn't make a move to even help open the door. I end up dropping my bags pick them up and put them in my room and leave the hotel to not see her face again and tell her off. Before leaving to cool off stop and the little store in hotel and shelves are empty whatever I do find is ridiculously priced. Rest of the night was ruined by the mood front desk girl have us at check in. Next morning I check out even before check out time to get out of this hotel.

The owners Rick and Rob greet you with a hug and know you by your name upon check in. The resort is very clean, relaxing and a whole lot of fun.  Continental breakfast is served daily with a variety of cereals, muffins, donuts, breakfast bars, milk, coffee, bananas, oatmeal, etc. Since I‚Äôm a foodie, my favorite part of the resort is during a 3 day weekend stay, they do a bbq for the entire resort. It gives everyone a chance to mingle, hang out, eat, drink and just have a great time. I also enjoy the fact that Rick comes out, hangs out with the guests and chats with us.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCmYzORsT9TLGS6SahkgtjTtEcOAvnX5kFsET8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQV_jwaoE4GMQGC4IdzZgcGUO9hVBDLZcquXvd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3jskhMuOJlCMGshomnXFh9g10B2CEVINOQxBK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1f3eUf4WFX8UYmG6cNvE7D1Q04MVC58qU5SDD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPozVQUANPpSjsMoTWdZJ9Cxz67W7nvGWi3c_jM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzvpMCY83xqeZdBG7HTGefUbZDwLdK1lPeuoID=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3EUMCAK_zQDWJNUltXiLMhXHeCGzQf9Rc3_K-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkiV4WudHB21mmjeUVNxTINMKDR5-CTUUKQOB0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcxuTCASQVXbZrVKmcpttQ2i5ZKf05rRrGd_DY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQssou35jR81RiTcgToer5e9Ra9vUM1ny7J6oA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9xe-NYCHJqLcKJ9Gh12dRqzpLr4rFIiAF-5tv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7zlMdtF_bwUXZf2MJhAUpRGYw0v6DkPdM0QQ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnb-fnpRrhXyy_shQPvsVIeOk8BxlxCJiSB-9W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk_7j2K6BJHmQiHYlUi4CN8Ha-6rfNl5qaKekd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj3WDllJwz2hJYaTS-JigfCqCQifbgKWyemRU3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x80db1b0c4d6bfc3b:0xf6a1bdc78f3b69ad,California,,,Positive,No message

1.0743261263966262e+20,Anthony Minier (DJ AnthonyM),2020-01-05 12:04:57.836,4,"This is a very comfortable enclosed gay men's resort. It is surrounded by high walls and the entry is through the check-in area so the owners (they live onsite) maintain some control over who is coming and going. This makes it one of the more mellow and quite resorts in this area and unless you are in your early 20's, you will appreciate the relaxed and easy going pace of this resort. The residences (studio's and suites) are in older buildings but they are well maintained and the whole complex has a certain charm to it. I have stayed here 3 times over the past so many years and have always enjoyed my visit immensely. They have a nice outdoor pool area which is clothing optional which also makes the high walls that surround the resort more useful since families driving by with children in their cars will not get an eyeful. There is a very large Jacuzzi as well. If you are gay and are visiting Palm Springs but the thought of the larger less intimate resorts that are often packed with a boisterous younger crowd don't quite appeal to your idea of a relaxing getaway, by all means try to book a room here. They are often fully booked since it is on the smaller side but you will be happy you stayed here if you book far enough in advance (or off season).",,0x80db1b0c4d6bfc3b:0xf6a1bdc78f3b69ad,California,,,Positive,No message

The hostel I stayed at in San Francisco was the worst cleanliness and kindness, but the LA Palm Tree House was a picture and review, so it was a play and a play, so the satisfaction was even better.

I was comfortable from 6/16 to 6/25 and both the boss and my family were very kind and I was more like a hotel than a family like my family.
It was really cleaner than the photos, the tray where you can organize your personal items, the dressing table where you can sit and makeup, and the breakfast that you prepare carefully every morning was delicious and the bread and fruit were served differently every day and I liked it. I also had a state-of-the-art washing machine and a drying hood so that I could wash my clothes for about two hours. I had two towels that were smoother than a top-quality hotel.

Location was also a good place to go to all sightseeing spots by bus on foot from 5 minutes walk, and to go owing.
And there was also a mascot Riley in the hotel, and the atmosphere was better, and I want to see it now and miss it. ~ I would like to see the boss and his family already ~

It was a good place to meet good people and make friends and get lots of good memories. If you are worried about Los Angeles Hostel, please choose without any worries. I will not regret it.

We stayed in the Abbot Kinney Suite, and it was a great experience. The suite had an open separate bedroom with desk and dresser with night tables on each side and a living room with a fire place. There was a cute kitchen with a deep sink and a claw foot tub and nicely tiled bathroom. The suite had windows everywhere and had massive amounts of sunlight. When you stepped out there was a balcony that overlooked Rose Ave and Venice Beach. (BEAUTIFUL) We sat our there often drinking and enjoying the view and atmosphere of Venice. The staff and owner were super nice and accommodating. The street was semi busy during the day and quite at night. There is a lot of restaurants around and the boardwalk is only steps away. The street parking was great. We always found a spot in front of the hotel. We came there to visit all of LA but just ended up stay in the area and keeping The Rose as our home base.

I was expecting an actual hotel with private toilet and shower. I was surprised when the staff showed me the shared shower room and toilets. This makes peeing late at night a lot more inconvenient, especially when the bedroom door uses  ordinary keys instead of an electronic card system. I didn't really like the experience.

It's unique, it's special, and it is a kind of  experience you should try, but the rooms can't be compared to a normal 4 star hotel room. The floor is wooden, the rooms don't have own bathroom, and the place is more like a weekend house than a real hotel.

Although you can tell that the rooms are old, they have done a respectable job renovating the rooms.  The heart shaped Jacuzzi is an awesome feature and it is big enough to comfortably accommodate two people.  The rooms were clean. New carpet and beds would make a big difference. Overall we were satisfied for the price we paid.  Microwave, refrigerator and a flat screen TV were nice new renovations.  The imitation fireplace was a very nice touch, had realistic animated flames and it put out some really good heat.  Was happy that there was a CVS and a Savemart next door and another great restaurant right down by the lake. (you can even see the lake from your back window upstairs).  If you are looking for a place that is kept clean for a good price, with a quaint atmosphere, this is where you should book.

We are California residents doing business nearby and decided stay for the evening rather than fight the rush hour traffic back to San Diego. The O.C Fair has caused rooms to be limited. The only reason I am succumbing to posting a negative review is to perhaps save someone who has saved long for a vacation from utter disappointment! The owners of this establishment should be ashamed of not only the run down but  the filthy condition of their establishment. When entering the first room assigned to us we found it had not even been cleaned from the previous occupants! Potato chips strewn all over the floor, soiled bed and other debris strewn throughout the room. They upgraded us. Laughable.

The upgrade to the ""suite"" the kitchen had a missing cabinet door, one of the two, broken glass in the Windows, the entry door had been kicked in and poorly patched and everything was disgustingly dirty, coffee table hasn't been wiped down in 20 years kind of grime!

Not Huntington Beach but Sunset Beach. So nothing ""Surf City"". The motel looks a bit run-down and does not attract the most trusted guests because of the price. Room was ok, the bed was clean, the carpet unfortunately not. So we'll spend a few dollars more next time.

Near the airport, this is undoubtedly an advantage when you are in LA, where almost everywhere has congestion, the hotel has no acoustic treatment whatsoever, the planes pass over the hotel literally to land and it seems that the plane is landing in the ceiling. The smell is horrible. The breakfast another calamitous situation, with no options of anything but 2 cereals, bread, butter, waffles for roasting and sweetened juices. The price does not justify staying in this as it is too expensive for so many problems, suggestion is that you look for this hotel as a last resort.

We had to leave a $50 cash deposit which was annoying bc I had to borrow cash from my sister as I didn't have it on hand. The room was decent and upgraded (fresh paint, granite in bathroom, flat screen TV). My sisters room smelled like smoke and a guy came to help us switch us rooms for her. They tried arguing it was a non-smoking room. Whatever room it is, someone smoked in there and they're not sleeping in that. We went to the pool, they were various degrees heated, one looked murky but we avoided it and had a good time. At night I constantly heard people coming up and down the stairs. It was so noisy. Lots of tweakers up and about. The website said breakfast was included but when we got to the lobby it was only coffee. At 11 someone knocked on our door seeing if we were checking out. Moments later at checkout, the front desk radios the guy walking around to physically check our room before giving the deposit back. I just felt like the whole time the hotel was trying to cover their butt and not really caring about the guest. But we checked out fine, got our deposit back and left.

About the only nice thing was the gal at check in and her hospitality. The room was very big had all the amenities as posted. But there was some kind of stench about it like backed up sewage or something. I was hoping that with time it would dissipate. However, i ended up going to buy some Lysol disinfectant and that only seemed to help for a short while then there smell came back. Luckily i take a sleeping pill so I was able to sleep early. But I was awakened by the sounds of semis in the parking lot at around 2:30. I could not get back to sleep so I stepped out to smoke a cigarette. When I went back inside room I turned the heater on. Once I did that the smoke detector went off. Funny how no one from front desk even came to check on the room. I was finally able to reach the detector and turn it off myself. I decided to start packing but was too tired. I finally got to sleep at around 6:30 am and slept for couple hours. I was afraid I was going to oversleep and be charged an extra night. Thank God I got out. I usually try to avoid places like motel 6 but any motel 6 would be like a palace compared to this place.  I am no snob by any means and I don't have a very big travel account but i would skimp on other things to be able to afford a nicer hotel.

It is clearly recently made repairs. Office and rooms are fresh. The rooms are large, quite decent furniture and plumbing, as for a motel. The territory is fenced, uninvited guests do not run hither. There is a swimming pool outside. We did not swim - it was cold.
The room has the necessary minimum, including a coffee maker and direct coffee.
Awesome beds. With my height of 172cm I had to almost jump on the bed. Feel like a fur seal from Pier 39 :-). Slept very comfortable.
Prices are quite affordable. Great American motel. Recommend!

It ruined our night. Even worse when we came back to the hotel , that same door was left unlocked so anyone could enter our hotel and a couple was trapped in elevator. I called the staff and they were completely clueless and no help at all. Worst experience ever in a hotel and this is very dangerous given we were not able to properly exit the hotel. If your building were to ever catch on fire, everyone would be trapped with no way to escape.

Elevator not working -guest service told me to call them back in 5 minutes which is completely unacceptable
Door unable to be opened-my friend called the guest service and he had a horrible attitude. After telling him that no-one is able to open the door from the outside or inside he responded snidely with : its a matter of turning the knob.",,0x80d95359bf883bfb:0xb7a3880f201e2142,California,2019-11-13 16:14:46.755,"Hello Ashley,

We stayed in a room for a couple of nights. Fortunately, the building is within walking distance of a bunch of great bars, a CVS, and restaurants. Our room had a kitchenette, which is great for days when we didn't feel like eating out. Some things we didn't like so much were the loud noises from the surrounding bars and the lack of parking. But we appreciate that ear plugs were supplied. There is a parking structure nearby, but it is not free. We did stay here right before Comicon, so parking was difficult to find. Also, keep in mind that the rooms are like studio apartments. We didn't mind this, but just know that you'd be cooking and sleeping in the same room. Overall, I'd recommend Nest on Fifth if you are fairly young and enjoy the San Diego night life.",,0x80d95359bf883bfb:0xb7a3880f201e2142,California,2019-11-13 16:22:04.435,"Hi Edward,

1.0206633197060371e+20,A A,2019-02-14 03:12:50.788,4,"I checked in at 0100 AM, due to a delayed flight. I thought my situation was bad, until an elderly couple rolled in, having escaped wildfires near their home, only to take an Amtrak train that, as it turned out, would go through ANOTHER wildfire area in Colorado. By the time them made it to San Francisco, CA (by plane), they were even more weary than me. Our female receptionist checked us all in with a warm smile, and bottles of free water. Funny how the smallest gesture can mean so much. My double queen (or was it full?) bedroom was clean, and quiet, and conveniently located around Fisherman's Wharf. Breakfast was free for my room package, which I booked on one of those ""book now, and we'll tell you the name of your hotel later"" sites. I think I paid $137 via Priceline. Comfortable bed, but awkward layout through may hallways, and ""catwalks"" to get to my hotel, where half was remodelled to be more contemporary, while the other half (apparently) was still traditional in feel. $$ Expensive, so not much (by San Francisco standards). UPDATE:  There are 6 buildings, so if your Room Number is 2601, you will be on the 2nd Floor, Building 6.  Building 1 contains the Gym, while Building 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are linked together with a series of long hallways that provide adequate light, although seem like a fair amount of wasted space.  As of 02/14/2019, the renovation is nearly complete, with a completion date of Summer 2019.  The renovation will include large, updated lobby, and concierge (now assigned to a sad table in a sad, temporary lobby), and get this Superb Restaurant, and Dining Experience! As of this review, there is Cafe Express (or some similar sounding name) that is up a small flight of stairs, off of the ground floor.  Outdoor Pool, gated and open between 0800 - 2200, no life guard.  Gym, 24 hours a day.  Nice rooms (minus the shower enclosure, which is Formica.) Some rooms with balconies, and patios.  Many suites are located on the 4th Floor.  Parking is $63, but across the street at the Safeway parking lot, it is $36.  I would recommend Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf Hotel, SF, CA.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTVIgXOeL72xP_L_ODHSFwyIRWAwA48CX7rya-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcCqD2RyeEZPbddgA_yakwFiBlCGdjDtwctNZ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI68jQEb_a3vSi6CnSEIKiURq5dRQL2Ps9ai9v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHffsZ5yIdZYQ683rv3nxGk9YG7ax4F2cx1o6f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM53JuS_SzrTn6qSB93Pha2miemCJXGfMR_hh4z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPISNCxKsBzs79X8J-AQE992Jr_qW1RroWjCvUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfuuy1BYYrdPURWHHzMZyU-eDXrf9oLeuw3rWB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEG_6bKabiH-f-YaXPgdtlK1f2WPMZqEb7oS_b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX6ddUXMYMvB6I--cK9mqqIoWsVJ5QE_1hUpVS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPzCKdFwwhI0o5IzYE0gcdNG0EZFK8HF5aiuY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrY-gD6zWJwjurf9-Iqd3mf7p5WEkHqzhqy75_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFt3vi49BhjZs-lMOvVcxJMdILxZ8eaxI62xc_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8vkpjuSN48v2sUQ6g-nsQr5YyCz_LZr0tvcX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM23Pyh79hTqbf8L7QmjZwaPSPKgBFmO86w0tPF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEwbz9kJ4grELNQm0S6HZh5aTw-rwFgAbiIgc1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl5_d1ecJ-bZqtGEYJz5HXC8HQAeiKq0B-JMWG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFR7btfPzjRr2LlulKGIGmFlIowhYyUhilkQzN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjOI4FdCULnm4obLdBtii5brVI2KSx4ylPPstp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9,California,,,Positive,No message

Our room was located on the corner of Beach and Mason, across street is a parking lot.  There was a car playing loud music with heavy base.  We reported to the hotel, buy they can not do much since the location was not part of their property.  Music played passed midnight.  I stayed at other hotel in the area and never had the same problem.  Even though it‚Äôs not the hotel‚Äôs fault but I think I need to address this.

Location is also great if you want to take the ferry to Sausalito/Tiburon as its very close to Pier 41 which is very close to the very popular Pier 39.  So in terms of mega popular touristic location this is it! I wouldn't want to be in this area the whole time though as its very popular with families! The hotel has really great fireplaces outside but unfortunately it is not sufficiently manned so there are numerous homeless people taking up space while hotel guests end up sharing!

1.09499285826037e+20,Philip Tagatac,2019-01-14 12:57:10.534,5,"5/5 stars with ONE flaw: parking.

The Pros:
Excellent guest service, kind staff and overall a pleasant experience getting to the room. The keycard sensor on the three elevators adjacent to the lobby are somewhat finicky, so you *might* have to swipe your card another time to make sure it scans. Walking to the rooms, the scent was neutral (unless you pass a cleaning card, which in that case it smells like ammonia), and the floors were clean.

Like most chain hotels, you will expect to see crisp, unwrinkled bedsheets and pillowcases, which is what I saw, and a clean bathroom. Overall, 5/5 for the room. I had 0 issues with noise, as my room was positioned looking over where guest would be dropped off via taxi/Uber/Lyft.

As far as convenience goes, this place is PERFECT for the first time traveler to SF. Safeway and CVS are literally a 30 second walk across the street, and Fisherman's Wharf is only a 5 minute walk from the Sheraton. Great breakfast and lunch places are available within 5-10 minutes walking, and if you need groceries, Trader Joes and Safeway (again) is a short jump, skip and a walk away.

My ONE flaw with this place is parking. At roughly $70 per night, it hurts a doctoral student's budget. Granted, $70 will allow you to take your car in and out as many times as you like, but if you're in the city, you tend NOT to drive your car in and out. My suggestion is to park upstairs at the Safeway. You won't be able to take your car out unlimited times, BUT they will only charge you $36 a night. Take it with a grain of salt, but I'd rather park across the street for two nights for the price of one at the Sheraton. I left my car there overnight for two nights, and had 0 issues. It's guarded and well lit as well. So if you don't need to move your car, definitely consider parking at the Safeway.

Again, great location for first timers to the city. Convenient to touristy areas, and not too far of a drive to downtown.",,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9,California,,,Positive,No message
1.1475505688074795e+20,Freddy Marcel-Marcum,2018-12-29 18:12:02.488,1,"I'm giving this hotel one star not because of the actual facilities, they seem pretty nice actually. No, I'm giving the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf a thumbs down because of a rather ugly incident that took place last night involving a doorman and a family group of 20 tourists from Newcastle, Australia around 7pm, 28 December.

I'm an airport shuttle driver, my boss calls me just as I'm finishing a sixteen hour shift, hey, go to the hotel, couple of families going to the Westin by the airport, you and another driver handle it, good luck. Cool, I can manage that. Show up, and immediately am met by a doorman, some sort of Pakistani guy, five-six, balding, who has made it clear I'm not getting out of my vehicle until I agree to ""take care of him"", which in his rapid-fire thickly accented English basically came down to pulling a scam by inflating the agreed upon rate of $60 per vehicle to $90, claiming to the guests there were no other airport shuttles available and he was essentially saving the day by calling us. I'm a large Czechoslovak man, with that look in his eye and especially being born under communism, I don't like bribery, out of my way.
NOW, I've been driving commercially since I was a junior in high school off and on, three different continents, Iraq, driving a school bus in college, limos, I've had half of Hollywood in my backseat, and I love a good hustle, but lying to guests? Lying to people you're supposed to be assisting? I don't do that. My hustle is showing up on time and driving safely, or showing passengers where they can get weed or cheap concert tickets in San Francisco, I deal with graft and hustling every day, it goes with the job but dude, this guy came in last at Hustler U, and probably never paid off his student loan. He really thought he was going to scam two families headed by oil rig men? World travellers like those families? And then whining about tips from the fathers? Hell I give him credit for trying, that's like me driving Formula 1 expecting to win first place. We had a good laugh about it on the way to the airport. What wasn't so funny was the fact this guy called his buddy with a Chrysler van and CRAMMED nine people in a six-passenger vehicle and whisked them off before the other driver from my company with a nine-passenger vehicle could arrive. There was no hurry to get them out, they weren't even catching a flight, but he was so greedy he was willing to break all kinds of SFMTA and California vehicle laws in order to get a cash kickback it was alarming. Also, a flat rate for medallion holding taxi drivers in San Francisco to the airport is $35, not the $60 you told them it was. This hotel isn't a jihadist small arms bazaar, you don't lie and swindle people for what is essentially what you make in an hour. And you didn't even help them with their suitcases and luggage, you let the women do it instead? What a gentleman.
Buddy, as far as being taken care of, you need to take care of guests, ESPECIALLY if they include women and girls and young children in prams, and forget your wallet. You make probably four times salary what I do, especially in this season, in a safe heated building, and I'm not giving you a dime for doing what Sheraton International hired you to do. You can screw over gullible newlyweds from Iowa or tourists who don't speak English, nobody can stop you, but don't try to hustle a hustler or people accustomed to guys like you, you'll fail every time, and I am forwarding this to corporate.

Remember the Golden Rule of hustling bud: it's only a hustle if you're the only one in on it and the person being hustled thinks they're the one coming out on top and has no idea what's really going on.

May be the adjacent room's wireless thermostat kept turning mine on?  Who knows, I was in room 3222.  Also the floors/ceilings are not robust.  I literally heard every movement of the occupants in the room above me as they were walking around at 6am.  The hotel also charges exorbitant fees ($17.99 per day) for in-room wi-fi.  The fee is waived if you sign up for their SPG rewards program.  I'm already a member, but I didn't book through their app, so I wasn't able to get free internet.  Not a huge deal, but really makes me feel their rewards program is worthless because most middle class people don't stay exclusively at one hotel chain in 2017.  You can collect $5 worth of points for not getting room service.  But seriously, you'll probably lose that benefit if you book at regular rates through their app or website.  It's also very unappealing to get price-gouged on something as trivial as internet.  Overall, the stay was not worth it at all.  The free internet that they do provide is in the lobby, where it gets crowded with people using it and also slows down your connection.  Not a 4-star hotel experience at all.  No wonder they were Pricelining at ~$92 when other 4-star hotels were at $250 for that particular week.  Also, the front desk wasn't very friendly, I tried to push checkout to 2pm because of the AC, but they gave me until 1pm saying they were at capacity.  Right....sure....at $86/night on Priceline you're at full capacity...such BS. Having the ""engineer"" come up to examine your AC unit at 9am because you couldn't sleep isn't my idea of a comfortable 4-star stay.  Thankfully, the engineers were able to manually shut it off.  I have slept better in a 1-star hostel and probably would have gotten complimentary wi-fi.  Almost all hotels in 2017 in San Francisco offer complimentary internet.

Musky smell, probably due to the fact that the pastel (yes pastel) multicolored carpet had never been shampooed. And then there was our room - where to begin...
1) water stains from an old leak on the ceiling 2) Filthy windows with drips of bird feces splatter on a window that didn't open.
3) Wall paper that was beginning to peel off
4) Doors that must have been recycled from an old demo somewhere in the wharf. They did not fit whatsoever and would allow light to beam-in through the gaps all night.
5) No fridge in room
6) No water pressure in shower

8) Horrible sound insulation
9) Found and killed one of the most disgusting spiders I've seen in years.
10) Smoke smell coming in from adjacent rooms, but to be honest, we can't blame the hotel for that as they can't control the actions of others, but just thought it would be worth a mention.

This is just not a 4 star, and this particular Sheraton really shouldnt advertise such. Plus this place DOES NOT warrant a $300.00/night  price tag, especially when the Holiday Inn just steps away offers FREE WiFi and a Continental Breakfast at $250.00/night

Have not regretted it and do not want to repeat all the positive recessions now, but only briefly summarize the most important highlights for us from ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"",
who contributed to our next visit to SF,
Would stay here again at the Sheraton.

And that is very clear on the one hand, the unique central location for all sightseeing tourists.

The main attractions
San Francisco can be reached in a few minutes on foot.

So is z. B.,
lively Pier 39 just one block from the Fisherman's Wharf area.

Also the Marketplace, Lombard Street, the Coit Tower or the turning point of the famous
""Cablel Car"" is only a few 100 m away.

And in the evening, after just a few meters, we were at the city's most popular tourist attraction, Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf with its special entertainment, exciting shopping and amazing food.
It really doesn't get any better.

Just as great is the beautiful hotel of the Sheraton Group,
it just has style and a certain flair that we love on vacation,
just don't want to do without.

For this unique experience
we didn't want to this time either
save on the price and have,
I have not regretted this decision in any way. Probably also because you don't treat yourself to something like this every day.

But there should also be days
where one says
we deserve that.

In summary, it can be stated that we were ""VERY SATISFIED"" with the hotel staff (especially John R.) who had largely taken our prior requests into account), room, hotel atmosphere / cleanliness, free WiFi and its special location for sightseeing and would always go back go to ‚ÄúSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äù here.

For us a ‚Äúfirst-rate sightseeing hotel‚Äù to treat yourself to something very special in life.

Einfach TOP !!!
Haben es nicht bereut und wollen jetzt nicht alle positiven Rezessionen wiederholen, sondern nur kurz, die f√ºr uns, wichtigsten Highlights vom ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú, nochmals zusammenfassen,
die dazu beigetragen haben, dass wir beim n√§chsten Besuch in SF,
wieder hier im Sheraton √ºbernachten w√ºrden.

Und das ist zum einem ganz klar, die einmalige zentrale Lage f√ºr alle Sightseeing-Touristen.

Die wichtigsten Attraktionen
San Franciscos, sind in wenigen Minuten fu√ül√§ufig zu erreichen.

So befindet sich z. B.,
der lebhafte Pier 39 nur einen Block vom Fisherman's Wharf Viertel entfernt.

Auch der Marketplace, die Lombard Street,  der Coit Tower oder der Wendepunkt der ber√ºhmten
‚ÄûCablel Car‚Äú ist nur wenige 100 m entfernt.

Und abends waren wir bereits nach wenigen Metern, auf der beliebtesten Touristenattraktion der Stadt, den Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf mit seinen Special entertainment, Exciting shopping and Amazing food.
Besser geht‚Äôs wirklich nicht.

Genauso spitze, ist das sch√∂ne Hotel der Sheraton-Gruppe,
es hat einfach Stil und einen gewissen Flair, auf den wir im Urlaub,
einfach nicht verzichten m√∂chten.

F√ºr dieses einmalige Erlebnis,
wollten wir auch diesmal nicht
√ºber den Preis sparen und haben,
diese Entscheidung in keinster Weise bereut. Wahrscheinlich auch deshalb, weil man sich so etwas nicht alle Tage g√∂nnt.

Aber es sollte auch Tage geben,
wo man sagt,
dass haben wir uns verdient.

Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass wir mit dem Hotel-Personal (besonders John R.) welcher unsere Vorabw√ºnsche, weitestgehend ber√ºcksichtigt hatte), Zimmer, Hotelatmosph√§re/Sauberkeit, kostenlosen WLAN und seiner besonderen Lage f√ºr Sightseeing ‚ÄûSEHR ZUFRIEDEN‚Äú waren und w√ºrden jeder Zeit wieder hier ins ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú, gehen.

F√ºr uns ein ‚ÄúFirst-rate sightseeing Hotel‚Äù, um sich im Leben auch mal, etwas ganz besonderes zu g√∂nnen.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP0Nkli36Yw0Atxjn3zKbgZzp5hqsY8HHeu9M-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvwXhCy6jd2UCyLQR80AOtmdwLcfg5sswmN3KR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaB01ff_PnB-9WxjBp_CiTmb5t8DIEBpT8QHfB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPTxTvo6w1gpdQwzdCCnLEoXnLfr52ebm2fUV2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9,California,,,Positive,No message

In any case, we were completely satisfied and also have it,
not regretted for various reasons,
To have chosen this hotel with its approx. 530 rooms.

The Sheraton Hotels have a proven standard,
who has never disappointed us and
everything was right here again,
what you want from a good sightseeing hotel.

It couldn't be more central for all sightseeing tours.
Almost everything can be reached on foot within a few minutes.
So is z. B. The lively Pier 39 in the Fisherman's Wharf area is just one block away.
The turning point of the famous ‚ÄúCablel Car‚Äù is only a few 100 m away.
From there, you can continue to the many other sights of the city,
such as going to the legendary Chinatown or the shops of Union Square.

All in all we have here at ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"",
excellent accommodation with pleasant comfort and
a very personal service (thanks John R.) B.
not only advised us expertly, but also our wishes
- as far as possible - had taken into account.
Our thanks also go to the on-site experts at the concierge desk,
who gave us excellent advice and valuable tips

We also really liked the appealing hotel ambience.
We would like to especially mention
the comfortable seating at the hotel entrance,
very romantic with an open fireplace (see photo),
to review the day again.

Also the outdoor pool, also with a constantly burning fireplace,
We liked it very much.

Since we had a ""Sheraton Club Card"", we were also able to
Breakfast is free of charge in the lounge, which is unfortunately not too large.
And the internet connection was also free.

We found the hotel parking fees and breakfast to be very expensive.
But you can get both items much cheaper in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.

In summary, it can be stated that
that we with the hotel (room, service, hotel atmosphere) and its great location / surroundings,
VERY SATISFIED ‚Äúwere and would be again any time
go to ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"", ""
but also to treat yourself to something very special.

For us, a first class and exquisite hotel ‚Äúof the first rate‚Äù.

Spitzenhotel, Spitzenlage;  Einfach Super

Wir waren auf jeden Fall rundum zufrieden und haben es auch,
aus diversen Gr√ºnden nicht bereut,
dieses Hotel mit seinen ca. 530 Zimmern ausgesucht zu haben.

Die Sheraton Hotels haben eben einen bew√§hrten Standard,
der uns noch nie entt√§uscht hat und
hier hat mal wieder alles gestimmt,
was man sich von einem guten Sightseeing-Hotel w√ºnscht.

Zentraler f√ºr alle Sightseeing-Touren geht es nicht.
Fast alles ist fu√ül√§ufig innerhalb von wenigen Minuten erreichbar.
So ist z. B. der lebhafte Pier 39 im Fisherman's Wharf Viertel nur einen Block entfernt.
Auch der Wendepunkt der ber√ºhmten ‚ÄûCablel Car‚Äú ist nur wenige 100 m entfernt.
Von dort aus, kann man dann weiter zu den vielen weiteren Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten der Stadt,
wie etwa zum legend√§ren Chinatown oder den Gesch√§ften des Union Square fahren.

Alles in allem haben wir hier im ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú,
eine hervorragende Unterkunft mit angenehmem Komfort und
einem sehr pers√∂nlichen Service (Danke John R.), der z. B.
uns nicht nur fachkundig beraten hat, sondern auch unsere W√ºnsche
-so weit es m√∂glich war- ber√ºcksichtigt hatte.
Unser Dank, gilt auch den Vor-Ort-Experten vom Concierge-Schalter,
die uns hervorragend beraten und wertvolle Tipps gegeben haben

Auch das ansprechende Hotel-Ambiente, hat uns super gefallen.
Besonders erw√§hnen m√∂chten wir noch,
die gem√ºtlichen am Hoteleingang befindlichen Sitzm√∂glichkeiten,
sehr romantisch mit offener Feuerstelle (siehe Foto),
um den Tag noch mal Revue passieren zu lassen.

Auch der Au√üenpool, ebenfalls mit einer st√§ndig brennenden Feuerstelle,
hat uns sehr gut gefallen.

Da wir eine ‚ÄûSheraton Club Karte‚Äú hatten, konnten wir auch,
in der leider nicht allzu gro√üen Lounge, kostenlos Fr√ºhst√ºcken.
Und auch der Internetanschluss war kostenlos.

Sehr teuer fanden wir die Hotelparkgeb√ºhren und auch das Fr√ºhst√ºck.
Aber beide Posten, kann man auch in direkter Hoteln√§he viel billiger bekommen.

Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen,
dass wir mit dem Hotel (Zimmer, Service, Hotelatmosph√§re) und seiner super Lage/Umgebung,
SEHR ZUFRIEDEN‚Äú waren und w√ºrden jeder Zeit wieder
ins ‚Äû‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú,‚Äú gehen,
allein auch, um sich mal wieder etwas ganz besonders zu g√∂nnen.

F√ºr uns, ein erstklassiges, und exquisites Hotel ‚Äúof the first rate‚Äù.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzSAdt8Os4GsDf9GKJ4oIvbZ8hm61iN-CzVig8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_ut8BYfhd0KGNB3W0HgearhBP9jrJZOosqqfl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9mfjONNMfOFrvQrDt1ofuUCtYUDqTM0h73pvi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGRIfs5MDmWRH1qZO8TlK4MDq_k3Ou16-veJT7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxDd3xSIrO2hLnVfyBsu6XD4uoP5LWFigZWiGh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYzPdDyFJAL3JUw0x-UMiQZLqf8w1ZVpwg4wbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaufKVb2JBDkVtQfMN9TC4HvETFZ9r9-akX7pj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdp0s_TvWsE8P2Dd66PlhjmxLvcwfKmPS99LMD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkUJeBTK17bQp0pqqumQcdUpLPo8gUMc6VfBXw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ5bjkw4Vd2KNIYCDjoiuvXNRMv_OUe3PCtvaq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSU7oTBXMKSWvuApv9TfIB1oU_qgsUzdJxk7t4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLIyZqp1rjjrURj-soyl7ttH-0HHS-8ky1a1D_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZg9sVEGVQqurLYWVyCbeyJRN-5T_XKdZxdPXe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9,California,,,Positive,No message

The hotel also has vending machines and a swimming pool.

1.0961741892706392e+20,Troy Walker,2017-02-26 03:11:32.074,2,"Centrally located in Midtown, Best Western Midtown (formally known as Howard Johnson Los Angeles) is an average hotel in a less than average area. While it was recently renovated, the new Best Western Midtown is barely up to par with other Best Westerns in California. While it has some extra amenities such as Direct TV and a gym, the parking structure is severely inadequate, the area is quite noisy, and the rooms and service are average at best. Customers should expect that they won't have an official parking spot and that the parking staff will have access to their cars and will either move them without notice or be blocked in. While the hotel is within walking distance to downtown LA, it is at the intersection of two very busy streets causing noise at all hours of the day and night. The surrounding areas would also probably be considered 'suspect' to those from other areas. While convenient, the location doesn't outweigh the cons of the hotel and the Best Western Midtown would be far from my first choice of places to stay on a trip to southern California.",,0x80c2c77b7f48f751:0xa87be42b2b3ec2bd,California,,,Positive,No message

Very pleased with the whole service. Check-in was quick, with a specific mention for Travis who was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable of the local area. The two rooms I stayed in were well equipped and very clean. The bed was large and exceptionally comfortable with plenty of good pillows - possibly the best hotel bed I've used in a long time! Standard service includes free WiFi, free continental breakfast including cook-your-own waffles, and also free parking. The central location has many restaurants nearby - Taylor's steakhouse, Denny's, IHOP, plus all the usual fast food burger joints and of course the many Korean BBQ.  The only complaints I would have is that the car park and breakfast room are rather small - I stayed during a quiet period but I imagine if the hotel was full during peak periods it could become busy and rather difficult. One night was quite windy and the bedroom windows rattled noisily. Likewise the extractor fan in both bathrooms seemed to do little except make a lot of noise. Only little niggles, and I'd still definitely stay here again on my next visit.

The internet connection was pitiful, he claimed that the only room available was the one he gave me on the 4th floor facing 6th street. NOISEY. I was awoken by a symphony of sirens every couple of hours each night of my stay, but that's not even the worst. They do not offer smoking rooms (massive bummer if you have to climb 3.5 flights of disgusting stairs to smoke outside), And, even though he claimed it was the only room left, I don't recall seeing any other guests stay there once I checked in. He wouldn't allow my mother to pay over the phone, so we had to do it over email (a little strange). In the end, I checked out kinda bummed that the hotel manager had given me the room with the worst chance of sleep. But, had also had over charged my moms debit card by 100 bucks. When I called to ask him to reverse it he claimed it was the banks fault and to talk to them about it, despite the fact he charged 328.70 on 5/28 at about midnight AT THE BEGINNING OF MY STAY. Since then, David has continually hung up the phone on me, I have even brought it up with HoJo's customer care on-and-off, time-and-again, only to be told basically ""we'll get back to you"". If it was a MOTEL6  manager they would have been fired immediately for failing to correct an overcharge. The only way that I could have gotten a $100 fee is if I had a ""cancellation"" but unless checking out before 11AM is considered a cancellation, there is nothing in the ""hotel policy"" he tried to use as defense to charge me over 300 dollars for two nights in a room he knew I wasn't going to be able to sleep in. I have been taken advantage of before, but I never felt so backhanded and insulted for calling out what could have been an honest mistake but the only thing that was honest about him was that ""doesn't know anything about that"". Maybe somebody who knows about how to treat customer complaints should be running ANY hotel, let alone one that is supposed to get my 3-star rating. AVOID THIS HOTEL AND IT'S MANAGER DAVID before he tries to take your credit line or bank account hostage and then tells you that he can refuse service because their policy says it's okay if you've already paid. JUST STAY AT THE MOTEL 6, OR ANYWHERE ELSE. Never again will any Howard Johnson get a nickel out of me. I still haven't got my refund. Their company also outsources their Reservation Toll-free number to the Philippines who have no idea what state LOS ANGELES is in; I am morally against outsourcing of American customer service jobs, because nothing makes an angry customer happier than hearing the thickest of an Alabaman Drawl ask how to help you. Anyways, yeah avoid this place, head for the hills. Don't give this David guy a cent of your hard earned dollar. I'm sure that somebody will care at some point, and that somebody's job is to care about making sure people or Managers who trick people into paying for 3 nights get terminated and possibly sued. I'm not sure, I'm just a 21 year old kid from San Diego who knows BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, and THIEVERY when I see it.",,0x80c2c77b7f48f751:0xa87be42b2b3ec2bd,California,,,Negative,No message

I stayed with my two teenaged sons:  Our room was comfortable; our bathroom was spacious (with a nice little thing rigged in the corners of the tub to keep the floor dry).

The indoor pool was very relaxing, and the hot tub was great.  ...What we liked best though, was the friendliness of the staff.

My fianc√© and I both woke up with nasty bug bites here and the other people staying here were nasty crackheads and probably full of body lice. There was a guy huffing paint under the stairs and another guy sitting outside scratching his his dirty injection marks on his arms. We paid for a suite because the rooms are too small and the first room we got the toilet wasn‚Äôt even connected to the floor. We paid extra to go to a bigger room and weren‚Äôt even able to use the shower because they have terrible plumbing issues. We were told we couldn‚Äôt use it and we still paid and both rooms had bugs. Maintenance and security came to our room multiple times because the plumbing was so bad it leaks in the walls and flood the rooms downstairs. The first room we had was downstairs and was full of mildew probably from their plumbing problems. Building is nasty and old should probably be condemned but that‚Äôs not stopping them from charging an absurd amount of money for the awful experience you will have there. Even though it‚Äôs near the strip it‚Äôs not worth it. All kinds of homeless people living in the parking lots and on the street to the strip.

After driving onto the lot I realized that this place is far closer to the Las Vegas strip than expected. The check-in process was extremely pleasant and quick, because the motel was relatively empty the front desk staff gave me an amazing room - corner location on the top floor, overseeing the MGM Grand! Excellent room, clean, organized and really cool location.
the MGM is across the street and within 10 minute walking distance. If you are interested in exploring the Southern part of the Strip you can easily book this motel.
Wifi: This place has free WIFI. It is not the fastest but it works for the applications I had in mind (email, booking websites, flight status checks via the Delta app). I wouldn't rely on this Wifi for HQ youtube videos, but with the Las Vegas Strip across the street you won't need Youtube anyway!

Staff is amazing and professional, I highly recommend this motel for single travelers, business travelers, couples without kids (with kids there might not be enough space but maybe they also have larger rooms).",,0x80c8c5ca75bc5fc7:0x5e5fda46afde4c9a,Las Vegas,2018-05-08 16:33:57.879,"Dear Valued Guest: Thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review for our team.

I feel like if im staying numerous days i should receive some type of discount. Because $120+ for this room is waaaaay overpriced, so i usually dont stay on weekends. But they have laundry and snack/soda machines. Theres also an atm in the lobby. Option for a cash deposit would be great too.

1.108279035057802e+20,Irina Grigorieva,2018-06-17 16:14:10.700,1,"(Translated by Google) This motel is NOT recommended. Perhaps, in the building where the reception is located, you can feel safe, since it is open around the clock and there are video cameras, but in the buildings behind it it is scary. Despite the fact that the Strip and some cool casino hotels are within walking distance, a rather deserted area begins behind the motel. further is the airport. Old furniture, dead plumbing, lamp TV and noisy air conditioning. You can turn off the air conditioner, but it will be stuffy. And it is better to keep the door closed at night. And not only at night, but also in the morning and during the day. We were faced with a situation when our acquaintances, with whom we were traveling in a group, were attacked early in the morning. An African American with a spray can burst into the room, took a backpack with valuable things. At 8-50 am (!). The police then came to the call, of course, but it was too late. The impressions of visiting Las Vegas were spoiled. It's a pity. Cool city! It is better to pay extra for a normal hotel and not spoil your pleasure.

But regardless the big blue roofed hotel across from Caesar's is one of the best spots to stay. 1. once you figure out how to get to your room, which may be a bit confusing at first, you will find it's an easy in and out hotel to get to the strip as fast as possible.  It's not a super deep hotel so it's about a 3 min walk out once you hit the casino floor.  2.  It's always dirt cheap to be central strip and stay here.  3.  They have balconies so if you want to get some fresh air most of the rooms towards the back have a great view and lots of fresh air.  I've never felt the room was dirty and I feel it covers everything you need for the trip.  I've stayed here quite a few times for as little as 18$ a day to 75$ so really not too bad if you think about it!

The Japanese-style room is large and has a home feel. Mr. Da Ren Ren Zhi, helped me solve a lot of clothes to be washed with less expensive hotel rates, gave me advice on excursions in the Kansai area, recommended and booked dinner for me (especially Kobe beef). He has done two things that I will never forget in my 30 years of travel experience. 1

This area is actually very noisy, and Asian restaurants and shops are always buzzing. This hotel is just a few steps from the subway, which is the closest and only a few miles from La Guardia. I feel that it is very reasonable to give the waiter a $14 parking fee. The hotel is only one stop away from Citi Field, or just 15 minutes on foot. Overall, the service was very good and the room was very good.

I came here with some girlfriends and we had a great time!! We came just to get drinks but we ended up staying for dinner because the vibe here is amazing!! This is the most beautiful rooftop and you will get the most amazing photos as well!!

When you get out of the elevator you get greeted by the most friendly staff (rare in NYC). Then they take your temperature with a super cool photo monitor (you have to see it to believe it!).  There is hand sanitizer at every table and the servers are wearing masks. We appreciate the level of high safety measures being taken!! Thank you!!

Love this place and it should definitely be on your bucket list if you are in NYC.

The waitress was obviously up selling us as soon as we got to the table - offered shots (which we got), prompted us to get better alcohol instead of house (which we did); and yet service was still extremely slow. We had to ask for water multiple times. Our food came out before drinks.

Mushroom pizza was pretty good; better than the pepperoni, tomato and pepper one (tasted like Subway).

You have to make reservations in advance and pay a deposit but it gets added to your bill. The menu isn't that intense so we stuck with the pizza but the bar will make whatever drinks you want. The staff is super friendly and honestly it feels like the Hamptons in Manhattan. Should definitely check it out. They also give you a huge bowl of spicy cashews if you order it.

To many amazing options close by. Go elsewhere.

We arrived around 530p on a Saturday.¬† The place was at less than 50% occupancy.¬† Yet, they insisted on placing our party of three at a two person setup. Rude.

Beyond this, they had the windows shut and did not have the ac on. The place was a sauna - break a sweat hot. We opted to leave.

Ezy, the floor manager, was rude to my party and the one in front of us.¬†¬† Customer service is not his strong suit. When we left another couple left as well and the only sizable party they had left as well.

To add insult to injury the uniforms are horrendous. Very 1950s nursing home. I don't know who the are catering to.

I didn't expect much from a Roadway Inn or of any Choice Hotel for a matter of fact. But this place takes the cake for the worst at service and the absolute nastiest room that I have ever stayed in. My military accommodations in Kuwait in Iraq were more attentive and clean. You shouldn't use this place if you have small children or a compromised immune system for the fact that you are likely to end up in the hospital. The place is filled with pubic hairs and cigarette smoke. The staff is miserable to include the highly impaired manager whom was clearly under the influence of something strong. Tony's attitude is award winning and demeaning. The personal insults and disregard of people with disabilities was just shameful to witness. Choice Hotels will be hearing from me and in particular about Tony's questioning of a Desert Storm Veterans disability. Tony the nasty receptionists whom has a personal calling to involve herself in others conversations and unwitting ability to propel insult toward customers valid complaints.

I just had my daughters 5th birthday party at the pool. We talked with them face to face with a Penny in May in June she emailed me which I have. I called said wait for me to figure out whether or not we want food (only cake was allowed everything was to be bought from the kitchen which I understand) but she said ""it was on the books""

Well day of the party July 9th show up no one knows anything about it. There was garbage all around the pool (pretty normal for this place) no chairs or tables, water everywhere not even close to the pool, & the kitchen was closed so we couldn't get food if we wanted. Only perk the man working the desk was helpful.

Called to complain to the company that I spent that much money on renting out the pool for a private event to have it go so bad. They sent me to the assistant manager who then told me this was my own fault. There needed to be a down payment and signed contract. I have witness with me as well as emails to prove there was no mention of either. He said she never would do that and I should of called to do it. Basically calling me a lair.

It vainly wasn't the fanciest place ever, but it was decent. No, the accommodations weren't the most modern. The regular rooms were a touch small, but they were clean and the balconies were nice. We had friends who got a suite, which was much roomier. The pool was EXCELLENT.. very large, and they even have a lifeguard on duty. Front desk staff wasn't the friendliest, but we talked to the manager a couple of times, and she was fantastic. Don't eat at the restaurant, the are CLEARLY not prepared for more than 2-3 tables at a time. We ate dinner and breakfast there, and service was painfully slow (though the good was pretty good).

I would definitely go back here.,,0x89dd22a23b7058f7:0xaae7dda2ffb44830,New York,,,Positive,No message

Don't believe all of these nasty reviews because this place isn't THAT bad. They have good wifi so that's a plus. But in my room they only have one outlet and it is in the corner of the room. I left my extension cord at home and I wouldn't want a long wire in the middle of my room anyway. You have to set the clocks and the rooms are kind of old fashioned. It's good though like me who is only staying the weekend and is visiting someone in college. So in conclusion, I believe that people are just exaggerating and that this place is a ok place to stay.

EDIT: I thought this was a good place to stay. I had written that review a hour after we got the key. That was before the beds. They were so uncomfortable I couldn't even sleep. The breakfast was just a few muffins the size of my thumb with coffee that tasted very dull.  All together, this place looks like it was frozen in the 70's. The beds were like cardboard and the shower water smelled funny.",,0x89dd22a23b7058f7:0xaae7dda2ffb44830,New York,,,Positive,No message

When we asked to sing a song, the old man ""dj"" held up a sheet of paper with like 5 names on it and said don't bother it was gonna be a long wait. So we sat and tried to wait. The problem is that a bunch of woo hoo girls (and not the good kind) were holding on to mics, listening to their own music, and occasionally throwing in a lyric of a refrain of a song. The same 6 girls held the microphones and proceeded to have their own conversation. Not letting anyone do actual karaoke. When we reviewed on Facebook, the staff was quite snarky and retorted with ""well we are sorry you didn't have fun like everyone else did"" and ""that is how they like to do karaoke here"" umm, pardon me but 1. That isn't karaoke, and 2 you will never attract new customers with attitudes like that.

He snapped at me and held up a sheet (with about 5 names on it) and said that it would be a long wait. I then sat through two more songs with the same drunk 7 women holding the microphones and occasionally singing a half chorus of whatever lame song they chose.

Taxi driver didn't like the hotel because of the neighborhood. He said be careful but next morning early I walked to the Jamaica‚Äì179 Street Station to Manhattan. It was perfectly fine to walk by nice houses and neighborhood. Breakfast was not good everything was packed. Room size for a 6.1 feet tall with two bags was small but it was silent. Silence is important because if you can't sleep it is not important how wide room that you stayed.

My last visit I wasn‚Äôt to satisfied with the cleanliness of my bed and sheets. Recycling sheets and pillows after a long time of being used, is completely unsanitary. A low budget hotel or not, there‚Äôs certain requirements when running an establishment like so. Also, I just currently came here and I‚Äôve never heard of a hotel that doesn‚Äôt let you check in until 4 pm especially when check out for previous over night guests is at 12 pm. No one can wait in the lobby. I took 2 hours to get here and I‚Äôm pregnant, the receptionist explained that I couldn‚Äôt wait until check in time which was only a hour to come after my arrival. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. With the amount of funds this hotel receives everyday there is no reason that you guys still have yet to buy new things, upgrade items and at least train your workers with common courtesy. Honestly, if this problem persists... as a active member of the community board, I will gladly bring this problem to their attention and push for a thorough investigation.

When I got there the manager was at the front desk, playing on his cell phone, and didn't even bother to acknowledge my existence for a good 2-3 minutes while he finished what he was doing. No  'hello', 'how are you', nothing. I got a frank ""Checking out?"" ""Yes, at 3:30p I am checking out."" ""Huh"", messes around silently with the computer for another 1-2 min, ""Are you Bridgett? I need your credit card"". We get checked in and he tells me I'm going to need to wait while he tried to find the housekeeper because she was supposed to call him at 3 to tell him rooms were cleaned but ""apparently has chosen not to today"". Professional. Comes back 5 minutes later to tell me I can go to my room. The room. Wow. Carpets look like they hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Room smelled like musty, stale cigarettes. The window curtains were stained with God knows what (probably uncleaned blood for the brutal attack that happened there 6/5/2016-as i learned later). Around midnight, there's a knock on my room door. By the time I get to the door, gone. I make sure the door is double locked from the inside and get back in bed. Then I can hear someone outside the room with a key trying to get in the room. I get up, throw the door open, and asked ""what can I do for you?"" This poor guy apologizes, saying he saw the door tag on the door and informed the desk clerk that someone was in this room but they insisted the room was empty and told him to try getting in anyways. Wonderful. Beds suck and are uncomfortable but at this point are the least of my concerns. The next morning I woke up to staff outside my door very loudly complaining about another customer that had just checked out. When I checked out the woman at the front told me I was all set and asked ""Did someone come to your door last night? We don't even have you in our system"". Really? Because the guy clearly knew my name and took my money. ""Oh yeah, that was the manager. He can be a bonehead."" Absolutely unreal. The entire stay was disgusting from services to conditions of the room. I'll never waste my money with Days Inn again.",,0x89de0d1933c5eb53:0x30862ff9c89c138a,New York,,,Negative,No message

In the room nothing worked or was connected. You could only watch TV of you could figure out the proper way to hookup and program the cable box. Air conditioning was an almost laughable myth. First you have to plug it in yourself. Then it doesn't cool the air, just blows the hot air gently around the curtains. Don't bother trying to call the front desk. Your phone phone, clearly marked as being from a room on a different floor, has a dial tone, but none of the keys work. It would matter anyway, there is no maintenance staff to fix the air conditioning, out phone. While there was a mini fridge and a microwave, they had be negated for some time. Freezer burned food had become one with the tiny freezer unit in the fridge.

The bathroom was usable, but only just. For a family of four, only two bath towels, one hand towel, and one wash cloth were provided. The empty tissue box was left in the wall dispenser with no replacement available. One roll of toilet paper was provided on the back of the toilet, as the two holders were broken. Black mold is clearly visible on the drop ceiling and in every corner.

The bed was a long size as advertised. Being extra soft and springy, the toddler found it worked best as a trampoline.

Our mirror in the bathroom was held together by duct tape and the towel rack fell off the wall when I removed a towel. We paid a lot of money for a ""package deal' that came with an $80 gift card to their two ""amazing"" restaurants. We were excited to go to Lorenzo's which was supposed to be the higher end restaurant, but it was never open. Since Traveler's was the only other place to take the gift card we had to go there, the food was pretty good but the service was absolutely horrible. There were four waitresses standing around talking the whole night while one poor waiter tried to keep up with every table. They also forgot to tell us that neither of the restaurants are open on Sunday so we were left with $30 on the gift card that could never be used.

Few places the hotel can improve are it's cleanliness, breakfast and temperature control. Ottoman & chair are stained and dirty (not a good sight).  Breakfast is free.

The Country Inn had mold in the tub, the phone didn't work, and other issues with the room.  They didn't change my room so I left. I went to Motel 6 and something must have been going on in the area because that was the only hotel available in Long Island City.  The only people there were others who couldn't find rooms at other hotels.  When I checked in,  I told the gentleman behind the desk of my experience at The Country Inn, and he laughed and said ""The phone here probably won't work either "". I thought he was joking until I got to the room and there was no closet, no ironing board or iron, the phone didn't work,  amongst other things.  I went to the front desk and the guy said that he'd make a note of it and if have to talk to the manager in the morning.  The manager the next day didn't come in until noon and still didn't care and did nothing about the issue.  I'd never stay there again and would recommend others not to go.

Our group decided to order the soups of the day- and there were a half dozen tempting offerings. I was torn between the Pork and Barley or the Cheeseburger Chowder. I ended up ordering the Cheeseburger Chowder and was very pleased with my selection. My only regret is that I ordered a cup rather than a bowl, because it was simply excellent! My companions opted for the French Onion Soup and they both raved about it. To go with our soups, we all ordered sandwiches- I had the Grilled Cheese, they had Reubens. Again, all of us agreed that our sandwiches were very tasty! I was very happy with the quality of the food, it was better than average. I feel the portions were generous too, as well as everything seemed very fresh and delicious.

Beyond the very satisfying meals, we all enjoyed the ambiance of this establishment. When you reach the front door, you immediately take note of a small plaque denoting that the place goes back to 1861, as a history buff I really found this interesting. It's clear that the building has been around a LONG time, it has the charm. It is a well maintained looking place and oozes charm and warmth. It was interesting to read that the same family has owned and operated the place for a century and it is also a functioning hotel! Pretty cool!

The service was good, our server was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable and fair. So, overall, in every aspect...The American Hotel left us pleased with our decision to check it out. We left saying that we would return! This place would make most people happy in my opinion!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVI3vgDnkkgvlMbi9hKvqfmi2XnMCw5BKZKbFV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpACn-v0RQ7H8JlI7Ew1zA8urXhMdIj1Hf797z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcW1s6WCHRLRoqSF51MryFKwEQpEecwBx6rRmW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6dxUXS3477GjLIeIlFjYUEuuCpJpGcZopt_11=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkLaUFgD9wEAlXyWlXZ3ykSXO65kOst2O3ysi0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXkj8Ly3JVejgvxk20qBbjoNE8dCStZ-UaLeNM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",0x89d146de5a94ee45:0x9c237574ffe7ae2d,New York,,,Positive,No message

I first had a very nice room at the front and then moved to a suite at the back, both on the top floor, which I think was the sixth or seventh.  I then, unfortunately, renewed via the internet and opted for a slightly cheaper room on the floor below, the mouse visitor having apparently left - true and not being snide, it was very small and the rooms were very clean - I put down food for it but then it disappeared.  There was some problem with the room change and I was asked to leave, perhaps because they found out about the mice feeding, and there were no rooms available on subsequent visits.  However, it was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in and convenient for food and I would highly recommend it, although having to be accompanied in the lift was slightly stressful and it's quite a long work otherwise.",,0x89c259a78a9e2a79:0x830b08f0443eb24d,New York,,,Positive,No message

You can take a nice stroll to Madison Square Park or the Empire State building. I love the TV service and mini fridge and the suite setup I had. However, I can only see more negatives about this hotel than I can see positive. I want to honestly say the hotel isn't worth what I paid for. It has cheap quality for expensive prices. I was already concerned when the receptionist looked like he didn't know what he was doing every time I walked through the lobby. I was right to be concerned because they put me in the wrong room. I will applaud the fast speed of resolving that issue, however; there were only two outlets in the room, both at very awkward and inconvenient locations. At one point the outlet fried my charger, forcing me to buy a new one after the receptionist looked clueless about my complaint. The toilet doesn't flush all the way, you'll have to flush it twice to get even a small sheet of tissue down. That was a big turn off for me. They deducted an extra $25 as a deposit in case there was any damages in the room after I left, this would be returned to my card if no damages were made. I can definitely understand this, but it was not mentioned to me at all upon booking my room which was very upsetting. When I first initially reserved the room, I was informed my grand total would be $380, but then the price raised to $410, and then it raised to $477. I don't understand why because I booked the room for what it was worth at $380 but ended up paying $477, such a total ripoff. I saw reviews and was warned by a random user to book somewhere else. But knowing we as humans have different tastes, I booked it anyway to give it a chance. But I'm very bitter about my stay overall and will not suggest this place to anyone. I wish I took the advice to book somewhere else.",,0x89c259a78a9e2a79:0x830b08f0443eb24d,New York,,,Positive,No message

Anyway, the rate was honored and it was a Boilermaker weekend, so trying to find a room close to the race is always a challenge. They helped out and found me and the family a place to crash the night before Mommy's race. Older establishment, but clean, and with very courteous staff. For the money you can't beat the proximity to the interstate and about 5 miles to ample dining etc. Convenient store and gas right across the street too.

My wife and I were in a barebones building that was due for floor and shower stall replacement. In fairness, these are old buildings that are probably updated when funds are available.  If you are a tent camper, accustomed to leaking tents and damp ground conditions our accommodation would be considered a ""glamping"" experience. And, for $585 for 7 nights this cabin is a bargain. Access to a beautiful lake with swimming, boating and fishing at your doorstep is a wonderful experience. Office and maintenance staff are wonderful people who respond to your needs.  Be aware that some cabins are accessed from upper road parking down pretty steep lawns.  Some renters were using their trucks and SUVs with AWD and 4WD to drive down grass slopes to unload and load their vehicles. I couldn't do this with my vehicle and had to make many trips back and forth to it arriving and departing. OK if your capable but consider cabin 155 with roadside parking if you're not.",,0x89dd9b8968d0b7a5:0x2b3773dcb07a920a,New York,,,Positive,No message

1.111363651380344e+20,An Sie,2018-09-26 06:16:26.702,3,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is located in NY on Butler Street in a small business park. There are car repair shops across the street. There is also work at night. So it is very loud there.
American breakfast is available.
The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful. It is approx. 10 to 15 minutes to the NY subway station Atlantic Terminal. Various subways leave from there. Another stop is Union Street. This is a little closer, but there are fewer subways there. You can be in Manhattan in about 20 minutes.
The hotel is simple and clean. However, because of the extreme volume at night, I would not recommend it. The rooms are also noisy.
There is no safe and no refrigerator in the room.
WiFi is free of charge, as is the use of the PC in the entrance area.

(Original)
Das Hotel liegt in NY in der Butler-Street in einem kleinen Gewerbegebiet. Gegen√ºber befinden sich Autowerkst√§tten. Es wird dort auch nachts gearbeitet. Somit ist es dort sehr laut.
Es wird amerikanisches Fr√ºhst√ºck angeboten.
Das gesamte Personal ist √ºberaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Bis zur NY-Subway- Station Atlantic Terminal sind es ca. 10 bis 15 Minuten. Dort fahren verschiedene U-Bahnen ab. Eine weitere Station ist Union Street. Diese ist etwas n√§her, allerdings fahren dort weniger U-Bahnen. Man ist in ca. 20 Minuten in Manhatten.
Das Hotel ist einfach und sauber. Wegen der extremen Lautst√§rke in der Nacht w√ºrde ich es allerdings nicht empfehlen. Ebenso sind die Zimmer recht hellh√∂rig.
Es gibt im Zimmer keinen Safe und keinen K√ºhlschrank.
W-Lan ist kostenfrei, ebenso die Nutzung des PC im Eingangsbereich.",,0x89c25c5e3e87ce9b:0x88bbf497193fae22,New York,,,Positive,No message

Room was clean but could use some updating as there was visible damage to one of the walls. Free breakfast was a plus and they had a decent selection of items to eat but the size of the serving area made it a bit easily crowded plus there was only 1 toaster and waffle iron which created a line in order to use those items.

They won‚Äôt even accept deliveries (courier) on behalf of guests, so I had to camp out at reception all day for UPS to arrive. The rooms are tiny, 15 ft by 15 ft at most and the ensuite toilet was an afterthought. Check in time is 1600 hrs; if you arrive early, as we did, we had to leave and come back after 1600 hrs. They charge USD7 for every piece of luggage stored in their luggage room.  A rip off, if you ask me; but we didn‚Äôt have a choice. Opportunist capitalists!

On the plus side, at USD29/night the rate is considered the cheapest in NYC; the fridge is large and they supply towels. The only useful thing reception did for us was to give us two sets of keys.

Savbeya station is 300-400 meters from the hotel. Trains go from it to JFK airport. In the room, I stepped on something sharp on the floor. A carnation was imperceptibly stuck in the pile of the carpet. Invited service personnel. A woman of about 50 came. I showed her this place. She shook her head - they say, ay-ay-ay and that was it. We lived in a room for several days. Nothing changed. This is how AIDS can be tolerated! Be careful and don't walk here without your slippers!

We booked two queens for me, my wife and daughter and we had just driven 6 hours.  They first tried to tell us that we booked a single (occupant) but our reservation clearly showed it was for 3.  The woman was making all kinds of BS excuses and lies.  The lobby stunk of chlorine and there was a paper sign stating the pool was out of service.
When we got to the room, it was just ok but kinda felt cheap.  The towels were absolutely horrible and were so rough they felt like brillo.  Would never go there again.  BE ADVISED!",,0x89d9e8d2ecfaaaab:0xe3eb74228cc16f6a,New York,,,Positive,No message

I was not told this until I noticed and addressed it at the front desk. Very abandoned feeling..thesmell of dry wall platter paints etc was annoying.

They took $15 off the stay. I was ok with that. Upon check in(3pm), I tried to find the entrance. The one that looked like it had tarps and dust all over. It looked like an abandoned building. I called to confirm the entrance and was told it was. There was plastic and dust everywhere in the ""lobby"". I brushed it off since they gave me a discount.  I got to the room and the key didn't work. The couple next door were having the same problem. Luckily the second key worked so I didn't have to go bacl to the front desk. I wanted to take a nap but it was still light out. When I went to close the curtains, I noticed they were very dirty. It was like someone with oil on there hands closed them. After my nap I wanted to watch t.v. but the satellite was down... I was quite disappointed but at least the wifi worked. The next morning when I went to shower I noticed quite a but of black mold on the ceiling and wallpaper in the shower. It made me feel dirtier than before I showered. I went to make coffee and of course remnants of the previous guests were still in the coffee maker. What a surprise.

The nearby environment is very quiet, parking and unloading luggage are very convenient. There is a paid parking lot across the street. South St seaport is just a few blocks away. The only downside is that it is a long way to get to the nearest Fulton subway station, which takes about ten minutes. This is not particularly good.

Our room supposed to be in upper levels but they got as the ground level. They forgot the housekeeping one day even tho we asked personally (they did it correctly the other days). Everyday is a new person in the front desk, I didn't like that, felt like in a hostel not a hotel. Rooms were clean when we got there, plenty of space to live, cook, etc. Out air conditioner was on the floor, beside the bed, so you can't sleep with the hot air straight to your face. There was no heater in our room (which is weird because the corridor had) just the air conditioner and a small portable heater. The WC is nice but the water does not get hot enough. When it's 30F outside it does make a big difference. TV is nice, a big 55"" brand new and good channels. Goos location, at least 4 dofferent metro lines go there as I can remember now.

The entrance is super sketchy and unless you're from NYC you'd think it was illegitimate. The room took way too long to be cleaned, there was still hair in the shower catch and our toilet was clogged when we got there. When we asked for someone to come up and help, the front door girl showed up with a plunger and meekly handed it to us to do ourselves.

On top of that, who ever hired the contractors to develop this hotel should be sued and then lose their licenses, there was dried grout all over the tiles, holes and pencil markings all over the walls, there are light switches that don't turn anything on and lights that have no switch! Our phone wasn't working so the handy man had to come in and out several times; turns out it wasn't even plugged in. The walls are incredible thin, we could hear someone else's TV blaring from down the hall and the gap between the door and floor is so huge you can see the feet of those who walk by.

The positives, very close to the subway and has a market right next door. The room are a nice space and while there clearly needs to be a management overhaul, it's clear that the front desk staff and handymen have good intentions and were very polite.",,0x89c25a10c46e5517:0xa6db57b222d111d9,New York,,,Positive,No message
