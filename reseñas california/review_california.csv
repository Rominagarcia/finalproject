I have stayed at many Days Inns thru out the US. I find these Hotels to be a nice stay for the value. Usually clean rooms, good customer service, and clean linen. But this Hotel was dirty, Horrible customer service and dirty linen. The room was Hot and uncomfortable to sleep. The sheets were dirty with food spots and other soils. The Carpet was also dirty with spots. Wires were exposed in the wall.

I called to be changed to another room and they told me they couldn't because they were full, which was not true. I stayed here for three days and pre-paid and they wouldn't give me a refund. Next time I would totally pay an extra 10 bucks and stay at another hotel.

Beds were nasty and forced us to go to Wal-Mart and buy sleeping bags. Inside of the rooms are falling apart.. burn marks on comforters. Carpet looked like they were slashed with a blade. TV was super snowy and direct tv was a joke. Only one channel worked for us. Called reception and it rang another room. Also, seems like there is long term residents here. Outside of building is falling apart as well and seems like no one cleans at all. There was trash everywhere. Roof is falling apart and missing shingles.

entire property is littered with garbage and cigarette butts. I was there when The Monterey County Health Dept.had red tagged the pool, locked it with their pad lock and had put a big warning sign on the entrance to the pool and jaccuzzi.

The carpets are so dirty that your white socks get black just walking around the room after a short period of time.

Musty rooms with boken microwaves, wires hanging out, wrecked cars and PODS in the parking lot, cig burns in the blankets, lumpy pillows on old mattresses,  beer cans and trash found under the bed, bare bones breakfast lacking anything remotely good for you, suspect people roaming the parking lot at night, etc. etc, etc..

Even the staff laugh at what they're asking for the rooms !!

The good:
- The service was amazing. Everyone we interacted with had the utmost level of professionalism. The doormen greeted me by name each time we came and went which was a really nice touch.
- The room had an incredible view of the Bay.
- Room service was very quick.
- Staff was very fast to respond to the Four Seasons in-app messaging.
- Everything was clean and modern.
- The crab and shrimp omelette was delicious.
- Wireless charger and USB ports on the nightstand was a nice touch.

The bad:
- The was no in-room dining menu in our room nor any instructions on where to find one. We had to ask for a link to the menu.
- The coffee was absolutely terrible.  I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it was some the worst I have ever had my life.  After disliking it in one meal, they provided it complimentary in another meal but it was still quite bad. The problem likely isn‚Äôt the preparation but rather the selected beans. SF has a number of amazing roasters, they should seek out a better option from a local roaster.
- Doors slamming all morning long. I don‚Äôt know if it was Staff or guests, but from around 8 am too 11 am, doors near our room were constantly being opened and closed and quite loudly.  This woke me up and prevented me from getting as much sleep as I wanted to.  The doors need to be assisted so they close quietly.
- The toilet paper was completely awful, very thin and quite abrasive. This was so pretty surprising detail and I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how the product they were using would even be considered remotely up to their standards.

Overall, it wasn‚Äôt too bad but I don‚Äôt think it lived up to their reputation. I know they recently reopened and there are mistakes to be expected but something like low quality toilet paper doesn‚Äôt really have an excuse.  I hope this review will allow them the opportunity to make improvements where there are currently deficits.

I‚Äôm not sure I would stay there again at that price point given the above issues.",,,0x80858061fa1762a5:0x197a26840ad26c3e

The scenery is great, you can see the beauty from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Harbour Bridge. The scenery here is so beautiful, and it will be even more beautiful at night. The rooms are large, well furnished and have all the facilities. Similarly, there will be small things like DVD players in the room. All the things you ask the staff to ask are fine, they are very helpful.

The fruit and bagels were decent enough but it felt more like a break room for employees than anything I'd consider to be for guests. No employees present, just a few guests, a few tables, and some snack foods tossed together.

The hand towel in the bathroom had a rather dark stain on it, I'm assuming from the last guest that put it back well enough the cleaning staff didn't bother checking. The overall cleanliness of the room was suspect...I found hair in the bed that wasn't mine.

I found the room to be clean with a nice big fridge and comfy bed. The lights freaked me out a few times until I figured out how to turn the sensors off. An important thing to know about this area is it gets very loud outside on the weekend nights, there is a billiard hall and a couple nightclubs with loud people and motorcycles. If you want to get any sleep friday or saturday night before 2am bring earplugs and tylenol pm. Across the street from the front desk there is a bakery that has the most amazing cream puffs and other treats. You can't beat the free parking, that is what always brings me back here during conventions, they lock the parking lot up at night for anyone who doesn't have a key so I felt safe walking back to my room after dark.",,,0x808fccb7339a1805:0xdbc868322a7462e9

The rooms are spacious and business grade.  You have free wi-fi, ice, central heating/air, clean linen, adjustable beds (sleep number), coffee maker, alarm clock radio, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap.  The view of the lake was grand with a fountain, geese on the water, a Koi fish pond with it's own fountain and a nice pathway.  The hotel also has a swimming pool with a safety fence a small amphitheater area with soft music coming through speakers when not in use. There are ice rooms located around the property with soda machines.

The convention rooms are elegant and host many events. There is a Grill that serves and offers room service, a Bar but my favorite is the dining room.  The breakfasts were fresh cooked daily whether it was served or buffet and refilled often.  The morning servers along with the chef and cooks were very friendly and personable. They were my favorite part of the experience not excluding Sylvia at the front desk.

The rooms are very clean along with their bathrooms. Because of the fear of bed bugs in some of the local motels and extended stay hotels this was a pleasant experience. alleviating those concerns. All concerns are addressed immediately (not that there should be any but things can happen).

Do be aware that during the wet season it tended to flood in front of the entrance to the hotel's property. (This might have been addressed by now)

I wasn't familiar with this three star hotel in North Palm Springs, and stumbling upon it was pure luck on my part.  The check in was quick and easy, and the front desk staff were efficient and friendly. They were able to answer my questions about the hotel and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. This is a limited service hotel as they don't have a restaurant on property.

I had a room with a king sized bed at the back of the property. The room was spacious, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the wifi was adequate, and the bathroom was clean. I didn't leave the a/c on when I wasn't in the room, so most importantly, the air conditioning was fantastic and cooled the room quickly. I also appreciated the large HDTV.

The pool area and jacuzzi faces south, so it's perfect for sun bathing.

This old Ramada Inn was renovated by the current owner, and they did a brilliant job. The interior designers transformed this tired chain hotel into a unique and hip boutique hotel. I would stay at The Monroe Palm Springs again without hesitation.",,,0x80db1bdacfda63bb:0xc745b6d9d106130c

The staff said it would be fixed the day we checked out. There were fire ants in the pool area and when we let the staff know, all that was said was ""oh great. I'll let maintenance know.""

I know what a value is when I see it.  Due to a fire in my home I needed a place to stay.  Having lived in Palm Springs for over 20 years, I watched as this hotel like most things in Palm Springs was brought back to life.  I never imagined it would be so nice and at such a great price.  Beats the heck out of Motel 6.  Better ptice, much nicer room, free wifi ($2.99 a day at Motel 6) and a free breakfast.  Not just a contintal breakfast or just coffee, but a real breakfast.  In a real restaurant with real servers and some of the best food in town.  Rick's has always been a favorite of my Late husband and myself.

Being that my reservations were for only 4 days they were able to find me a room for the remaining of my stay. The first room was big and roomy. Room 205. The second room had a balcony which the view was beautiful. Lush green trees, peaceful, Room 209.  What I really appreciated so much is that they allowed me to take care of my mom's service dog. My mom fractured her hip and could not take care of her pooch. I explained the situation and they allowed me to bring my mom's pooch to stay with me. They were so understanding, it was incredible, and meant so much to both my mom and myself. This really goes above and beyond. All of the staff are so nice. I would highly  recommend this hotel.

Despite its small size, it has a fantastic restaurant, very spacious and assortment of all kinds of food as well as a large selection to make a full breakfast before the day's departure.

On the other hand it is next to the Fresno airport so in 5 minutes walking you can take the next plane to Yosemite, Grand Canyon or San Francisco. A good place to spend a night and shot of bars and restaurants typical of the American West Coast.

We stayed on the ground floor. The room was nicer than Motel 6, but not $200/night nicer. Neighbors doors could be heard closing. Upstairs neighbors sounded lime a herd of elephants. Parking is bizarre, being underground and not well lit, plus no elevator from the bottom. For the money, you might expect more than plastic-wrapped grocery store danishes, bad coffee, apple and orange juices, toast, and apples and oranges. Maybe should have cereal, cocoa, more fruit options, yogurts, bagels, etc. Half the electrical plugs wouldn't hold the pins for our phone chargers amd the plugs are difficult to get to. No pool.

On the plus side, it's four blocks from the beach and across the street from the San Francisco Zoo and just a couple miles to the VA Medical Center. The beds aren't high end, but they are relatively comfortable. It's probably worth $100/night, but that's it.",,,0x808f7d7022cf8e85:0x68c3151307f1fca4

Even 1/2 of the toaster didn't work. There's no main room to eat, so you have to juggle your food & drink up the stairs to your room or make several trips.

Check in and go unload car with luggage's and bags as I get to front door I'm struggling to open door and the front desk girl just sits at her like a big ol slob and doesn't make a move to even help open the door. I end up dropping my bags pick them up and put them in my room and leave the hotel to not see her face again and tell her off. Before leaving to cool off stop and the little store in hotel and shelves are empty whatever I do find is ridiculously priced. Rest of the night was ruined by the mood front desk girl have us at check in. Next morning I check out even before check out time to get out of this hotel.

The owners Rick and Rob greet you with a hug and know you by your name upon check in. The resort is very clean, relaxing and a whole lot of fun.  Continental breakfast is served daily with a variety of cereals, muffins, donuts, breakfast bars, milk, coffee, bananas, oatmeal, etc. Since I‚Äôm a foodie, my favorite part of the resort is during a 3 day weekend stay, they do a bbq for the entire resort. It gives everyone a chance to mingle, hang out, eat, drink and just have a great time. I also enjoy the fact that Rick comes out, hangs out with the guests and chats with us.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCmYzORsT9TLGS6SahkgtjTtEcOAvnX5kFsET8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQV_jwaoE4GMQGC4IdzZgcGUO9hVBDLZcquXvd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3jskhMuOJlCMGshomnXFh9g10B2CEVINOQxBK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1f3eUf4WFX8UYmG6cNvE7D1Q04MVC58qU5SDD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPozVQUANPpSjsMoTWdZJ9Cxz67W7nvGWi3c_jM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzvpMCY83xqeZdBG7HTGefUbZDwLdK1lPeuoID=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3EUMCAK_zQDWJNUltXiLMhXHeCGzQf9Rc3_K-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkiV4WudHB21mmjeUVNxTINMKDR5-CTUUKQOB0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcxuTCASQVXbZrVKmcpttQ2i5ZKf05rRrGd_DY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQssou35jR81RiTcgToer5e9Ra9vUM1ny7J6oA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9xe-NYCHJqLcKJ9Gh12dRqzpLr4rFIiAF-5tv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7zlMdtF_bwUXZf2MJhAUpRGYw0v6DkPdM0QQ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnb-fnpRrhXyy_shQPvsVIeOk8BxlxCJiSB-9W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk_7j2K6BJHmQiHYlUi4CN8Ha-6rfNl5qaKekd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj3WDllJwz2hJYaTS-JigfCqCQifbgKWyemRU3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80db1b0c4d6bfc3b:0xf6a1bdc78f3b69ad

It is surrounded by high walls and the entry is through the check-in area so the owners (they live onsite) maintain some control over who is coming and going. This makes it one of the more mellow and quite resorts in this area and unless you are in your early 20's, you will appreciate the relaxed and easy going pace of this resort. The residences (studio's and suites) are in older buildings but they are well maintained and the whole complex has a certain charm to it. I have stayed here 3 times over the past so many years and have always enjoyed my visit immensely. They have a nice outdoor pool area which is clothing optional which also makes the high walls that surround the resort more useful since families driving by with children in their cars will not get an eyeful. There is a very large Jacuzzi as well. If you are gay and are visiting Palm Springs but the thought of the larger less intimate resorts that are often packed with a boisterous younger crowd don't quite appeal to your idea of a relaxing getaway, by all means try to book a room here. They are often fully booked since it is on the smaller side but you will be happy you stayed here if you book far enough in advance (or off season).",,,0x80db1b0c4d6bfc3b:0xf6a1bdc78f3b69ad

Korean locals living in the United States also come to stay here, so I think I know why the evaluation is good.

The hostel I stayed at in San Francisco was the worst cleanliness and kindness, but the LA Palm Tree House was a picture and review, so it was a play and a play, so the satisfaction was even better.

I was comfortable from 6/16 to 6/25 and both the boss and my family were very kind and I was more like a hotel than a family like my family.
It was really cleaner than the photos, the tray where you can organize your personal items, the dressing table where you can sit and makeup, and the breakfast that you prepare carefully every morning was delicious and the bread and fruit were served differently every day and I liked it. I also had a state-of-the-art washing machine and a drying hood so that I could wash my clothes for about two hours. I had two towels that were smoother than a top-quality hotel.

Location was also a good place to go to all sightseeing spots by bus on foot from 5 minutes walk, and to go owing.
And there was also a mascot Riley in the hotel, and the atmosphere was better, and I want to see it now and miss it. ~ I would like to see the boss and his family already ~

It was a good place to meet good people and make friends and get lots of good memories. If you are worried about Los Angeles Hostel, please choose without any worries. I will not regret it.

Our room didn't have enough towels upon checking in but the front desk was very accommodating and apologetic. There was a foul moldy smell from the a/c unit if it went above 74 degrees. The card key lock mechanisms are also frustrating and you need to insert twice, the lights blink backwards.

We stayed in the Abbot Kinney Suite, and it was a great experience. The suite had an open separate bedroom with desk and dresser with night tables on each side and a living room with a fire place. There was a cute kitchen with a deep sink and a claw foot tub and nicely tiled bathroom. The suite had windows everywhere and had massive amounts of sunlight. When you stepped out there was a balcony that overlooked Rose Ave and Venice Beach. (BEAUTIFUL) We sat our there often drinking and enjoying the view and atmosphere of Venice. The staff and owner were super nice and accommodating. The street was semi busy during the day and quite at night. There is a lot of restaurants around and the boardwalk is only steps away. The street parking was great. We always found a spot in front of the hotel. We came there to visit all of LA but just ended up stay in the area and keeping The Rose as our home base.

I was expecting an actual hotel with private toilet and shower. I was surprised when the staff showed me the shared shower room and toilets. This makes peeing late at night a lot more inconvenient, especially when the bedroom door uses  ordinary keys instead of an electronic card system. I didn't really like the experience.

The floor is wooden, the rooms don't have own bathroom, and the place is more like a weekend house than a real hotel.

Potato chips strewn all over the floor, soiled bed and other debris strewn throughout the room. They upgraded us. Laughable. Keep in mind I do not mind staying at the Super 8 for overnights, I do not require the Ritz Carlton for practical matters. The upgrade to the ""suite"" the kitchen had a missing cabinet door, one of the two, broken glass in the Windows, the entry door had been kicked in and poorly patched and everything was disgustingly dirty, coffee table hasn't been wiped down in 20 years kind of grime!

Near the airport, this is undoubtedly an advantage when you are in LA, where almost everywhere has congestion, the hotel has no acoustic treatment whatsoever, the planes pass over the hotel literally to land and it seems that the plane is landing in the ceiling. The smell is horrible. The breakfast another calamitous situation, with no options of anything but 2 cereals, bread, butter, waffles for roasting and sweetened juices. The price does not justify staying in this as it is too expensive for so many problems, suggestion is that you look for this hotel as a last resort.

I would not take it again, as they gave us a room with east orientation and it seemed that the planes came direct to us (it passes about 50 meters from the hotel, and the noise is unbearable).

The correct treatment, the clean but shabby room, the good thing is that it is close to all the car companies (Alamo, dollar, hertz ...) and, in addition, they have a free shuttle to the airport that leaves every hour.

Following with the room, the door could be opened with a kick, since it was very thin and very old. The area is not pretty, nor can you walk around, therefore, it is not for a week.

As for services, there is a Greek restaurant that closes very soon, a small pool, and they serve breakfast in the very basic small lobby, with juice, coffee, toast and little else.

El trato correcto, la habitaci√≥n limpia pero cutre, lo bueno es que est√° cerca de todas las compa√±√≠as de coches (Alamo, dollar, hertz...) y, adem√°s, tienen un shuttle gratuito hasta el aeropuerto que sale cada hora.

Siguiendo con la habitaci√≥n, la puerta se podr√≠a abrir con una patada, ya que era muy fina y muy vieja. La zona no es bonita, ni se puede pasear por los alrededores, por tanto, no es para pasar una semana.

They tried arguing it was a non-smoking room. Whatever room it is, someone smoked in there and they're not sleeping in that. We went to the pool, they were various degrees heated, one looked murky but we avoided it and had a good time. At night I constantly heard people coming up and down the stairs. It was so noisy. Lots of tweakers up and about. The website said breakfast was included but when we got to the lobby it was only coffee. At 11 someone knocked on our door seeing if we were checking out. Moments later at checkout, the front desk radios the guy walking around to physically check our room before giving the deposit back.

But there was some kind of stench about it like backed up sewage or something. I was hoping that with time it would dissipate. However, i ended up going to buy some Lysol disinfectant and that only seemed to help for a short while then there smell came back. Luckily i take a sleeping pill so I was able to sleep early. But I was awakened by the sounds of semis in the parking lot at around 2:30. I could not get back to sleep so I stepped out to smoke a cigarette. When I went back inside room I turned the heater on. Once I did that the smoke detector went off. Funny how no one from front desk even came to check on the room. I was finally able to reach the detector and turn it off myself. I decided to start packing but was too tired. I finally got to sleep at around 6:30 am and slept for couple hours. I was afraid I was going to oversleep and be charged an extra night. Thank God I got out. I usually try to avoid places like motel 6 but any motel 6 would be like a palace compared to this place.

We got into our room and found trash in the drawers from a previous guest.
In the second day of our stay room service was NOT DONE, bathroom area and shower were NOT CLEAN and beds were NOT MADE,  in our second night here was a lot of comotion outside of our room... lots of train noise since tracks are next to this place! Then a guy was screaming and knocking in a door and window of a another room... We know that this place was NOT 5 stars, but honestly even 2 is a lot for the bad performance specially in the cleaning area, this place represents themselves as a higher place to stay but is even worst than a cheap motel.",,,0x808582c7f4c98c55:0x85302867cadfd75a

It is clearly recently made repairs. Office and rooms are fresh. The rooms are large, quite decent furniture and plumbing, as for a motel. The territory is fenced, uninvited guests do not run hither. There is a swimming pool outside. We did not swim - it was cold.
The room has the necessary minimum, including a coffee maker and direct coffee.
Awesome beds. With my height of 172cm I had to almost jump on the bed. Feel like a fur seal from Pier 39 :-). Slept very comfortable.
Prices are quite affordable. Great American motel. Recommend!

I called the staff and they were completely clueless and no help at all. Worst experience ever in a hotel and this is very dangerous given we were not able to properly exit the hotel. If your building were to ever catch on fire, everyone would be trapped with no way to escape.

Elevator not working -guest service told me to call them back in 5 minutes which is completely unacceptable

Our room had a kitchenette, which is great for days when we didn't feel like eating out. Some things we didn't like so much were the loud noises from the surrounding bars and the lack of parking. But we appreciate that ear plugs were supplied. There is a parking structure nearby, but it is not free. We did stay here right before Comicon, so parking was difficult to find. Also, keep in mind that the rooms are like studio apartments. We didn't mind this, but just know that you'd be cooking and sleeping in the same room.

I thought my situation was bad, until an elderly couple rolled in, having escaped wildfires near their home, only to take an Amtrak train that, as it turned out, would go through ANOTHER wildfire area in Colorado. By the time them made it to San Francisco, CA (by plane), they were even more weary than me. Our female receptionist checked us all in with a warm smile, and bottles of free water. Funny how the smallest gesture can mean so much. My double queen (or was it full?) bedroom was clean, and quiet, and conveniently located around Fisherman's Wharf. Breakfast was free for my room package, which I booked on one of those ""book now, and we'll tell you the name of your hotel later"" sites. I think I paid $137 via Priceline. Comfortable bed, but awkward layout through may hallways, and ""catwalks"" to get to my hotel, where half was remodelled to be more contemporary, while the other half (apparently) was still traditional in feel. $$ Expensive, so not much (by San Francisco standards). UPDATE:  There are 6 buildings, so if your Room Number is 2601, you will be on the 2nd Floor, Building 6.  Building 1 contains the Gym, while Building 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are linked together with a series of long hallways that provide adequate light, although seem like a fair amount of wasted space.  As of 02/14/2019, the renovation is nearly complete, with a completion date of Summer 2019.  The renovation will include large, updated lobby, and concierge (now assigned to a sad table in a sad, temporary lobby), and get this Superb Restaurant, and Dining Experience! As of this review, there is Cafe Express (or some similar sounding name) that is up a small flight of stairs, off of the ground floor.  Outdoor Pool, gated and open between 0800 - 2200, no life guard.  Gym, 24 hours a day.  Nice rooms (minus the shower enclosure, which is Formica.) Some rooms with balconies, and patios.  Many suites are located on the 4th Floor.  Parking is $63, but across the street at the Safeway parking lot, it is $36.  I would recommend Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf Hotel, SF, CA.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTVIgXOeL72xP_L_ODHSFwyIRWAwA48CX7rya-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcCqD2RyeEZPbddgA_yakwFiBlCGdjDtwctNZ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI68jQEb_a3vSi6CnSEIKiURq5dRQL2Ps9ai9v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHffsZ5yIdZYQ683rv3nxGk9YG7ax4F2cx1o6f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM53JuS_SzrTn6qSB93Pha2miemCJXGfMR_hh4z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPISNCxKsBzs79X8J-AQE992Jr_qW1RroWjCvUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfuuy1BYYrdPURWHHzMZyU-eDXrf9oLeuw3rWB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEG_6bKabiH-f-YaXPgdtlK1f2WPMZqEb7oS_b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX6ddUXMYMvB6I--cK9mqqIoWsVJ5QE_1hUpVS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPzCKdFwwhI0o5IzYE0gcdNG0EZFK8HF5aiuY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrY-gD6zWJwjurf9-Iqd3mf7p5WEkHqzhqy75_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFt3vi49BhjZs-lMOvVcxJMdILxZ8eaxI62xc_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8vkpjuSN48v2sUQ6g-nsQr5YyCz_LZr0tvcX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM23Pyh79hTqbf8L7QmjZwaPSPKgBFmO86w0tPF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEwbz9kJ4grELNQm0S6HZh5aTw-rwFgAbiIgc1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl5_d1ecJ-bZqtGEYJz5HXC8HQAeiKq0B-JMWG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFR7btfPzjRr2LlulKGIGmFlIowhYyUhilkQzN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjOI4FdCULnm4obLdBtii5brVI2KSx4ylPPstp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9

The hotel has really great fireplaces outside but unfortunately it is not sufficiently manned so there are numerous homeless people taking up space while hotel guests end up sharing!

1.09499285826037e+20,Philip Tagatac,2019-01-14 12:57:10.534,5,"5/5 stars with ONE flaw: parking.

The Pros:
Excellent guest service, kind staff and overall a pleasant experience getting to the room. The keycard sensor on the three elevators adjacent to the lobby are somewhat finicky, so you *might* have to swipe your card another time to make sure it scans. Walking to the rooms, the scent was neutral (unless you pass a cleaning card, which in that case it smells like ammonia), and the floors were clean.

Like most chain hotels, you will expect to see crisp, unwrinkled bedsheets and pillowcases, which is what I saw, and a clean bathroom. Overall, 5/5 for the room. I had 0 issues with noise, as my room was positioned looking over where guest would be dropped off via taxi/Uber/Lyft.

As far as convenience goes, this place is PERFECT for the first time traveler to SF. Safeway and CVS are literally a 30 second walk across the street, and Fisherman's Wharf is only a 5 minute walk from the Sheraton. Great breakfast and lunch places are available within 5-10 minutes walking, and if you need groceries, Trader Joes and Safeway (again) is a short jump, skip and a walk away.

My ONE flaw with this place is parking. At roughly $70 per night, it hurts a doctoral student's budget. Granted, $70 will allow you to take your car in and out as many times as you like, but if you're in the city, you tend NOT to drive your car in and out. My suggestion is to park upstairs at the Safeway. You won't be able to take your car out unlimited times, BUT they will only charge you $36 a night. Take it with a grain of salt, but I'd rather park across the street for two nights for the price of one at the Sheraton. I left my car there overnight for two nights, and had 0 issues. It's guarded and well lit as well. So if you don't need to move your car, definitely consider parking at the Safeway.

Again, great location for first timers to the city. Convenient to touristy areas, and not too far of a drive to downtown.",,,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9
1.1475505688074795e+20,Freddy Marcel-Marcum,2018-12-29 18:12:02.488,1,"I'm giving this hotel one star not because of the actual facilities, they seem pretty nice actually. No, I'm giving the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf a thumbs down because of a rather ugly incident that took place last night involving a doorman and a family group of 20 tourists from Newcastle, Australia around 7pm, 28 December.

I'm an airport shuttle driver, my boss calls me just as I'm finishing a sixteen hour shift, hey, go to the hotel, couple of families going to the Westin by the airport, you and another driver handle it, good luck. Cool, I can manage that. Show up, and immediately am met by a doorman, some sort of Pakistani guy, five-six, balding, who has made it clear I'm not getting out of my vehicle until I agree to ""take care of him"", which in his rapid-fire thickly accented English basically came down to pulling a scam by inflating the agreed upon rate of $60 per vehicle to $90, claiming to the guests there were no other airport shuttles available and he was essentially saving the day by calling us. I'm a large Czechoslovak man, with that look in his eye and especially being born under communism, I don't like bribery, out of my way.
NOW, I've been driving commercially since I was a junior in high school off and on, three different continents, Iraq, driving a school bus in college, limos, I've had half of Hollywood in my backseat, and I love a good hustle, but lying to guests? Lying to people you're supposed to be assisting? I don't do that. My hustle is showing up on time and driving safely, or showing passengers where they can get weed or cheap concert tickets in San Francisco, I deal with graft and hustling every day, it goes with the job but dude, this guy came in last at Hustler U, and probably never paid off his student loan. He really thought he was going to scam two families headed by oil rig men? World travellers like those families? And then whining about tips from the fathers? Hell I give him credit for trying, that's like me driving Formula 1 expecting to win first place. We had a good laugh about it on the way to the airport. What wasn't so funny was the fact this guy called his buddy with a Chrysler van and CRAMMED nine people in a six-passenger vehicle and whisked them off before the other driver from my company with a nine-passenger vehicle could arrive. There was no hurry to get them out, they weren't even catching a flight, but he was so greedy he was willing to break all kinds of SFMTA and California vehicle laws in order to get a cash kickback it was alarming. Also, a flat rate for medallion holding taxi drivers in San Francisco to the airport is $35, not the $60 you told them it was. This hotel isn't a jihadist small arms bazaar, you don't lie and swindle people for what is essentially what you make in an hour. And you didn't even help them with their suitcases and luggage, you let the women do it instead? What a gentleman.
Buddy, as far as being taken care of, you need to take care of guests, ESPECIALLY if they include women and girls and young children in prams, and forget your wallet. You make probably four times salary what I do, especially in this season, in a safe heated building, and I'm not giving you a dime for doing what Sheraton International hired you to do. You can screw over gullible newlyweds from Iowa or tourists who don't speak English, nobody can stop you, but don't try to hustle a hustler or people accustomed to guys like you, you'll fail every time, and I am forwarding this to corporate.

Remember the Golden Rule of hustling bud: it's only a hustle if you're the only one in on it and the person being hustled thinks they're the one coming out on top and has no idea what's really going on. Anything else is just ripping off tourists, and here in the United States we look down on that hard.",,,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9

Be prepared to sit there waiting to flush a 2nd or 3rd time (and you will be waiting a while as the tank takes forever to fill thanks to using a ton of water in the first place). They do allow pets for no charge which can be good or bad depending on if you have pets or are allergic to them. Overall it's not awful and if you can get a good deal it may be worth it.

We said we didn‚Äôt want the money back that if they give us a voucher will be great.

This was the answer from Expedia...

We apologize for the inconvenience.Thank you for choosing Expedia...

The Sheraton shows that doesn't care about their customers. They will not work with you they just want your money. They don't care if you can't make it even if is due to weather!!! Shame on you Sheraton!!",,,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9

1.0184272710718725e+20,Peter D,2017-01-13 18:23:21.858,1,"Air conditioning unit is right next to the bed and it would randomly turn on during a cold night, blowing cold air right onto my face- I think because the thermostat is wireless and separate from the HVAC unit which is installed into the window.  May be the adjacent room's wireless thermostat kept turning mine on?  Who knows, I was in room 3222.  Also the floors/ceilings are not robust.  I literally heard every movement of the occupants in the room above me as they were walking around at 6am.  The hotel also charges exorbitant fees ($17.99 per day) for in-room wi-fi.  The fee is waived if you sign up for their SPG rewards program.  I'm already a member, but I didn't book through their app, so I wasn't able to get free internet.  Not a huge deal, but really makes me feel their rewards program is worthless because most middle class people don't stay exclusively at one hotel chain in 2017.  You can collect $5 worth of points for not getting room service.  But seriously, you'll probably lose that benefit if you book at regular rates through their app or website.  It's also very unappealing to get price-gouged on something as trivial as internet.  Overall, the stay was not worth it at all.  The free internet that they do provide is in the lobby, where it gets crowded with people using it and also slows down your connection.  Not a 4-star hotel experience at all.  No wonder they were Pricelining at ~$92 when other 4-star hotels were at $250 for that particular week.  Also, the front desk wasn't very friendly, I tried to push checkout to 2pm because of the AC, but they gave me until 1pm saying they were at capacity.  Right....sure....at $86/night on Priceline you're at full capacity...such BS. Having the ""engineer"" come up to examine your AC unit at 9am because you couldn't sleep isn't my idea of a comfortable 4-star stay.  Thankfully, the engineers were able to manually shut it off.  I have slept better in a 1-star hostel and probably would have gotten complimentary wi-fi.  Almost all hotels in 2017 in San Francisco offer complimentary internet.

From the moment we walked in, it did not feel like a Sheraton, NOR a 4 star. The layout in the lobby was akward and crowded. Seemed like the entire guest list was huddled in the lobby trying to use the free WiFi. I mean how could you blame them though with such a ridiculous price of $15.00 per night. Who charges for WiFi anymore? Especially in an apparent 4 star? Elevators felt like something out of  a horror story. Clicks and clanks the who way up. Lobby felt like I was from the abandoned set of Three's Company. Dated. Filthy thick dust all along the ceiling. Skylights and windows had never been cleaned since the hotel was built in think. Musky smell, probably due to the fact that the pastel (yes pastel) multicolored carpet had never been shampooed. And then there was our room - where to begin...
1) water stains from an old leak on the ceiling 2) Filthy windows with drips of bird feces splatter on a window that didn't open.
3) Wall paper that was beginning to peel off
4) Doors that must have been recycled from an old demo somewhere in the wharf. They did not fit whatsoever and would allow light to beam-in through the gaps all night.
5) No fridge in room
6) No water pressure in shower
7) $60.00/night parking
8) Horrible sound insulation
9) Found and killed one of the most disgusting spiders I've seen in years.
10) Smoke smell coming in from adjacent rooms, but to be honest, we can't blame the hotel for that as they can't control the actions of others, but just thought it would be worth a mention.

This is just not a 4 star, and this particular Sheraton really shouldnt advertise such. Plus this place DOES NOT warrant a $300.00/night  price tag, especially when the Holiday Inn just steps away offers FREE WiFi and a Continental Breakfast at $250.00/night

The staff was good, and after complaining to the front desk lady, she did what she could by giving me a $50.00 credit to spend in the hotel caf√©. I could tell her hands were tied, as she appeared to want to do more but (I'm assuming) she'd have some explaining to do if she did. I've worked in the service industry before, and if I was a betting man:
a) the owner is cheap and ONLY profit driven b) corporate has no idea in just how horrible disrepair and dated this truck-stop, motel-like place is in, and;

Have not regretted it and do not want to repeat all the positive recessions now, but only briefly summarize the most important highlights for us from ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"",
who contributed to our next visit to SF,
Would stay here again at the Sheraton.

And that is very clear on the one hand, the unique central location for all sightseeing tourists.

The main attractions
San Francisco can be reached in a few minutes on foot.

So is z. B.,
lively Pier 39 just one block from the Fisherman's Wharf area.

Also the Marketplace, Lombard Street, the Coit Tower or the turning point of the famous
""Cablel Car"" is only a few 100 m away.

And in the evening, after just a few meters, we were at the city's most popular tourist attraction, Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf with its special entertainment, exciting shopping and amazing food.
It really doesn't get any better.

Just as great is the beautiful hotel of the Sheraton Group,
it just has style and a certain flair that we love on vacation,
just don't want to do without.

For this unique experience
we didn't want to this time either
save on the price and have,
I have not regretted this decision in any way. Probably also because you don't treat yourself to something like this every day.

But there should also be days
where one says
we deserve that.

In summary, it can be stated that we were ""VERY SATISFIED"" with the hotel staff (especially John R.) who had largely taken our prior requests into account), room, hotel atmosphere / cleanliness, free WiFi and its special location for sightseeing and would always go back go to ‚ÄúSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äù here.

For us a ‚Äúfirst-rate sightseeing hotel‚Äù to treat yourself to something very special in life.

(Original)
Einfach TOP !!!
Haben es nicht bereut und wollen jetzt nicht alle positiven Rezessionen wiederholen, sondern nur kurz, die f√ºr uns, wichtigsten Highlights vom ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú, nochmals zusammenfassen,
die dazu beigetragen haben, dass wir beim n√§chsten Besuch in SF,
wieder hier im Sheraton √ºbernachten w√ºrden.

Und das ist zum einem ganz klar, die einmalige zentrale Lage f√ºr alle Sightseeing-Touristen.

Die wichtigsten Attraktionen
San Franciscos, sind in wenigen Minuten fu√ül√§ufig zu erreichen.

So befindet sich z. B.,
der lebhafte Pier 39 nur einen Block vom Fisherman's Wharf Viertel entfernt.

Auch der Marketplace, die Lombard Street,  der Coit Tower oder der Wendepunkt der ber√ºhmten
‚ÄûCablel Car‚Äú ist nur wenige 100 m entfernt.

Und abends waren wir bereits nach wenigen Metern, auf der beliebtesten Touristenattraktion der Stadt, den Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf mit seinen Special entertainment, Exciting shopping and Amazing food.
Besser geht‚Äôs wirklich nicht.

Genauso spitze, ist das sch√∂ne Hotel der Sheraton-Gruppe,
es hat einfach Stil und einen gewissen Flair, auf den wir im Urlaub,
einfach nicht verzichten m√∂chten.

F√ºr dieses einmalige Erlebnis,
wollten wir auch diesmal nicht
√ºber den Preis sparen und haben,
diese Entscheidung in keinster Weise bereut. Wahrscheinlich auch deshalb, weil man sich so etwas nicht alle Tage g√∂nnt.

Aber es sollte auch Tage geben,
wo man sagt,
dass haben wir uns verdient.

Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass wir mit dem Hotel-Personal (besonders John R.) welcher unsere Vorabw√ºnsche, weitestgehend ber√ºcksichtigt hatte), Zimmer, Hotelatmosph√§re/Sauberkeit, kostenlosen WLAN und seiner besonderen Lage f√ºr Sightseeing ‚ÄûSEHR ZUFRIEDEN‚Äú waren und w√ºrden jeder Zeit wieder hier ins ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú, gehen.

F√ºr uns ein ‚ÄúFirst-rate sightseeing Hotel‚Äù, um sich im Leben auch mal, etwas ganz besonderes zu g√∂nnen.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP0Nkli36Yw0Atxjn3zKbgZzp5hqsY8HHeu9M-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvwXhCy6jd2UCyLQR80AOtmdwLcfg5sswmN3KR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaB01ff_PnB-9WxjBp_CiTmb5t8DIEBpT8QHfB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPTxTvo6w1gpdQwzdCCnLEoXnLfr52ebm2fUV2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9

In any case, we were completely satisfied and also have it,
not regretted for various reasons,
To have chosen this hotel with its approx. 530 rooms.

The Sheraton Hotels have a proven standard,
who has never disappointed us and
everything was right here again,
what you want from a good sightseeing hotel.

It couldn't be more central for all sightseeing tours.
Almost everything can be reached on foot within a few minutes.
So is z. B. The lively Pier 39 in the Fisherman's Wharf area is just one block away.
The turning point of the famous ‚ÄúCablel Car‚Äù is only a few 100 m away.
From there, you can continue to the many other sights of the city,
such as going to the legendary Chinatown or the shops of Union Square.

All in all we have here at ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"",
excellent accommodation with pleasant comfort and
a very personal service (thanks John R.) B.
not only advised us expertly, but also our wishes
- as far as possible - had taken into account.
Our thanks also go to the on-site experts at the concierge desk,
who gave us excellent advice and valuable tips

We also really liked the appealing hotel ambience.
We would like to especially mention
the comfortable seating at the hotel entrance,
very romantic with an open fireplace (see photo),
to review the day again.

Also the outdoor pool, also with a constantly burning fireplace,
We liked it very much.

Since we had a ""Sheraton Club Card"", we were also able to
Breakfast is free of charge in the lounge, which is unfortunately not too large.
And the internet connection was also free.

We found the hotel parking fees and breakfast to be very expensive.
But you can get both items much cheaper in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.

In summary, it can be stated that
that we with the hotel (room, service, hotel atmosphere) and its great location / surroundings,
VERY SATISFIED ‚Äúwere and would be again any time
go to ""SHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF"", ""
but also to treat yourself to something very special.

For us, a first class and exquisite hotel ‚Äúof the first rate‚Äù.

(Original)
Spitzenhotel, Spitzenlage;  Einfach Super

Wir waren auf jeden Fall rundum zufrieden und haben es auch,
aus diversen Gr√ºnden nicht bereut,
dieses Hotel mit seinen ca. 530 Zimmern ausgesucht zu haben.

Die Sheraton Hotels haben eben einen bew√§hrten Standard,
der uns noch nie entt√§uscht hat und
hier hat mal wieder alles gestimmt,
was man sich von einem guten Sightseeing-Hotel w√ºnscht.

Zentraler f√ºr alle Sightseeing-Touren geht es nicht.
Fast alles ist fu√ül√§ufig innerhalb von wenigen Minuten erreichbar.
So ist z. B. der lebhafte Pier 39 im Fisherman's Wharf Viertel nur einen Block entfernt.
Auch der Wendepunkt der ber√ºhmten ‚ÄûCablel Car‚Äú ist nur wenige 100 m entfernt.
Von dort aus, kann man dann weiter zu den vielen weiteren Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten der Stadt,
wie etwa zum legend√§ren Chinatown oder den Gesch√§ften des Union Square fahren.

Alles in allem haben wir hier im ‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú,
eine hervorragende Unterkunft mit angenehmem Komfort und
einem sehr pers√∂nlichen Service (Danke John R.), der z. B.
uns nicht nur fachkundig beraten hat, sondern auch unsere W√ºnsche
-so weit es m√∂glich war- ber√ºcksichtigt hatte.
Unser Dank, gilt auch den Vor-Ort-Experten vom Concierge-Schalter,
die uns hervorragend beraten und wertvolle Tipps gegeben haben

Auch das ansprechende Hotel-Ambiente, hat uns super gefallen.
Besonders erw√§hnen m√∂chten wir noch,
die gem√ºtlichen am Hoteleingang befindlichen Sitzm√∂glichkeiten,
sehr romantisch mit offener Feuerstelle (siehe Foto),
um den Tag noch mal Revue passieren zu lassen.

Auch der Au√üenpool, ebenfalls mit einer st√§ndig brennenden Feuerstelle,
hat uns sehr gut gefallen.

Da wir eine ‚ÄûSheraton Club Karte‚Äú hatten, konnten wir auch,
in der leider nicht allzu gro√üen Lounge, kostenlos Fr√ºhst√ºcken.
Und auch der Internetanschluss war kostenlos.

Sehr teuer fanden wir die Hotelparkgeb√ºhren und auch das Fr√ºhst√ºck.
Aber beide Posten, kann man auch in direkter Hoteln√§he viel billiger bekommen.

Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen,
dass wir mit dem Hotel (Zimmer, Service, Hotelatmosph√§re) und seiner super Lage/Umgebung,
SEHR ZUFRIEDEN‚Äú waren und w√ºrden jeder Zeit wieder
ins ‚Äû‚ÄûSHERATON FISHERMAN'S WHARF‚Äú,‚Äú gehen,
allein auch, um sich mal wieder etwas ganz besonders zu g√∂nnen.

F√ºr uns, ein erstklassiges, und exquisites Hotel ‚Äúof the first rate‚Äù.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzSAdt8Os4GsDf9GKJ4oIvbZ8hm61iN-CzVig8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_ut8BYfhd0KGNB3W0HgearhBP9jrJZOosqqfl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9mfjONNMfOFrvQrDt1ofuUCtYUDqTM0h73pvi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGRIfs5MDmWRH1qZO8TlK4MDq_k3Ou16-veJT7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxDd3xSIrO2hLnVfyBsu6XD4uoP5LWFigZWiGh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYzPdDyFJAL3JUw0x-UMiQZLqf8w1ZVpwg4wbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaufKVb2JBDkVtQfMN9TC4HvETFZ9r9-akX7pj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdp0s_TvWsE8P2Dd66PlhjmxLvcwfKmPS99LMD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkUJeBTK17bQp0pqqumQcdUpLPo8gUMc6VfBXw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ5bjkw4Vd2KNIYCDjoiuvXNRMv_OUe3PCtvaq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSU7oTBXMKSWvuApv9TfIB1oU_qgsUzdJxk7t4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLIyZqp1rjjrURj-soyl7ttH-0HHS-8ky1a1D_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZg9sVEGVQqurLYWVyCbeyJRN-5T_XKdZxdPXe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x808580e4a4c38edf:0x9cb0d6a9ad8316b9

1.0961741892706392e+20,Troy Walker,2017-02-26 03:11:32.074,2,"Centrally located in Midtown, Best Western Midtown (formally known as Howard Johnson Los Angeles) is an average hotel in a less than average area. While it was recently renovated, the new Best Western Midtown is barely up to par with other Best Westerns in California. While it has some extra amenities such as Direct TV and a gym, the parking structure is severely inadequate, the area is quite noisy, and the rooms and service are average at best. Customers should expect that they won't have an official parking spot and that the parking staff will have access to their cars and will either move them without notice or be blocked in. While the hotel is within walking distance to downtown LA, it is at the intersection of two very busy streets causing noise at all hours of the day and night. The surrounding areas would also probably be considered 'suspect' to those from other areas. While convenient, the location doesn't outweigh the cons of the hotel and the Best Western Midtown would be far from my first choice of places to stay on a trip to southern California.",,,0x80c2c77b7f48f751:0xa87be42b2b3ec2bd

Very pleased with the whole service. Check-in was quick, with a specific mention for Travis who was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable of the local area. The two rooms I stayed in were well equipped and very clean. The bed was large and exceptionally comfortable with plenty of good pillows - possibly the best hotel bed I've used in a long time! Standard service includes free WiFi, free continental breakfast including cook-your-own waffles, and also free parking. The central location has many restaurants nearby - Taylor's steakhouse, Denny's, IHOP, plus all the usual fast food burger joints and of course the many Korean BBQ.  The only complaints I would have is that the car park and breakfast room are rather small - I stayed during a quiet period but I imagine if the hotel was full during peak periods it could become busy and rather difficult. One night was quite windy and the bedroom windows rattled noisily. Likewise the extractor fan in both bathrooms seemed to do little except make a lot of noise. Only little niggles, and I'd still definitely stay here again on my next visit. For the price, location, and service you really can't go wrong.",,,0x80c2c77b7f48f751:0xa87be42b2b3ec2bd

The internet connection was pitiful, he claimed that the only room available was the one he gave me on the 4th floor facing 6th street. NOISEY. I was awoken by a symphony of sirens every couple of hours each night of my stay, but that's not even the worst. They do not offer smoking rooms (massive bummer if you have to climb 3.5 flights of disgusting stairs to smoke outside), And, even though he claimed it was the only room left, I don't recall seeing any other guests stay there once I checked in. He wouldn't allow my mother to pay over the phone, so we had to do it over email (a little strange). In the end, I checked out kinda bummed that the hotel manager had given me the room with the worst chance of sleep. But, had also had over charged my moms debit card by 100 bucks. When I called to ask him to reverse it he claimed it was the banks fault and to talk to them about it, despite the fact he charged 328.70 on 5/28 at about midnight AT THE BEGINNING OF MY STAY. Since then, David has continually hung up the phone on me, I have even brought it up with HoJo's customer care on-and-off, time-and-again, only to be told basically ""we'll get back to you"". If it was a MOTEL6  manager they would have been fired immediately for failing to correct an overcharge. The only way that I could have gotten a $100 fee is if I had a ""cancellation"" but unless checking out before 11AM is considered a cancellation, there is nothing in the ""hotel policy"" he tried to use as defense to charge me over 300 dollars for two nights in a room he knew I wasn't going to be able to sleep in. I have been taken advantage of before, but I never felt so backhanded and insulted for calling out what could have been an honest mistake but the only thing that was honest about him was that ""doesn't know anything about that"". Maybe somebody who knows about how to treat customer complaints should be running ANY hotel, let alone one that is supposed to get my 3-star rating. AVOID THIS HOTEL AND IT'S MANAGER DAVID before he tries to take your credit line or bank account hostage and then tells you that he can refuse service because their policy says it's okay if you've already paid. JUST STAY AT THE MOTEL 6, OR ANYWHERE ELSE. Never again will any Howard Johnson get a nickel out of me. I still haven't got my refund. Their company also outsources their Reservation Toll-free number to the Philippines who have no idea what state LOS ANGELES is in; I am morally against outsourcing of American customer service jobs, because nothing makes an angry customer happier than hearing the thickest of an Alabaman Drawl ask how to help you. Anyways, yeah avoid this place, head for the hills. Don't give this David guy a cent of your hard earned dollar. I'm sure that somebody will care at some point, and that somebody's job is to care about making sure people or Managers who trick people into paying for 3 nights get terminated and possibly sued. I'm not sure, I'm just a 21 year old kid from San Diego who knows BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, and THIEVERY when I see it.",,,0x80c2c77b7f48f751:0xa87be42b2b3ec2bd

There are cheap and delicious Korean restaurants when you walk 2-3 blocks from the hotel.
There is also a shop specializing in papins on the back.
Breakfast mainly consists of bread and Danish, with little fruit and no vegetables.
There are few homeless people and the place is safe.
Because location is good and price is low, it is easy to use for subway and bus group.

The front desk was also nice and helpful.
There are few amenities, so I think you should buy what you need.
Personally, please consult the front desk here when you stay

The location is good and the edge of downtown is not too noisy. Korean restaurants close, coffee houses, bars and the like Korean, Walgreens pharmacy, supermarket and walk back Koreatown 6-7 minutes until the soil temperature. The gym is spacious and clean so it was great to exercise and the breakfast was good. The beds are too high, the bedding and the mattress are great. I don't know why the person below is not long enough to stay with me. It's so different from my experience. I think it's a bit expensive because of the location, and I didn't find anything special for the price.
